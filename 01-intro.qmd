# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Rainfall in Australia is not just weather; it is a story of extremes. Driven by massive climate cycles like El Nino, the continent swings violently between years of crippling drought and sudden, devastating floods.

For data scientists and meteorologists, predicting this is a unique challenge. It requires solving two problems at once: predicting **if** it will rain and predicting **how much** will fall. This report analyzes daily rainfall across Australia, building a model that handles both dry spells and heavy storms using statistical techniques designed for the kind of data weather actually produces.

## Why Standard Models Fall Short

Traditional regression methods assume data that behaves. Rainfall does not.

## The Three Statistical Violations
1.  **Too many zeros:** About **64%** of days in this dataset record exactly zero rain. Standard models try to average these dry days with wet ones, often predicting negative rainfall.
2.  **Extreme variability:** When it rains, the amount can range from a trace to a cyclone. The distribution is heavily right-skewed; a handful of extreme storms drive most of the variance.
3.  **Weather has memory:** Rain is not independent. A wet yesterday makes a wet today more likely. Standard models treat each day as a fresh roll of the dice.

## A Model Built for the Problem

This analysis uses a **Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG)** framework. Rather than forcing a single equation to predict both occurrence and intensity, the ZIG model splits the problem into two linked components:

1.  A **logistic model** predicts the probability that a day is dry versus wet ($\pi_i$).
2.  A **Gamma model** predicts the rainfall volume on wet days ($\mu_i$).



This dual structure allows the atmospheric triggers of rain, such as a dropping pressure front, to be modeled separately from the physical drivers of intensity like wind vectors and moisture availability.

## Why not Tweedie?
We considered a Tweedie distribution, which uses a single process for both outcomes. However, we rejected it because our exploratory analysis (see @sec-eda) showed that the drivers of occurrence are distinct from the drivers of intensity. Forcing a single parameter to capture both would obscure this physical reality.

| **04 Features** | Engineers wind vectors, cyclical time, and interaction terms. |
| **05 Modeling** | Builds the GLMM progressively from Null to Spatial Random Effects. |
| **06 Eval** | Validates the model using DHARMa simulation-based diagnostics. |
| **07 Selection** | Compares ZI-Gamma vs Tweedie and finalizes the model choice. |
| **08 Conclusion** | Summarizes findings and states operational recommendations. |

## Project Objectives

* **Recover missing data without bias.**
    Weather sensors fail. We implement a three-stage imputation strategy that fills gaps using temporal neighbors, multivariate patterns, and domain-specific inference.

* **Capture weather dynamics.**
    We model wind direction as continuous vectors, encode the non-linear interaction between sunshine and humidity, and quantify the Markovian persistence of weather states.

* **Account for spatial heterogeneity.**
    A model that works for tropical Darwin will fail in arid Alice Springs. We introduce hierarchical random effects that allow rainfall relationships to vary by location.

* **Validate the model.**
    Standard accuracy metrics can mask poor fit. We use simulation-based residual diagnostics to stress-test the model and confirm that it captures the true data-generating process.
