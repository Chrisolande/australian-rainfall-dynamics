    "section": "2.3 Missingness Diagnostics",
    "text": "2.3 Missingness Diagnostics\nBefore designing an imputation strategy, it is necessary to understand the mechanism and structure of the missing data. The choice between imputation methods depends critically on three questions: whether missingness is random with respect to other variables in the dataset, whether missing values cluster at specific locations or time periods, and whether the four most-affected variables fail independently or as a coordinated group. A strategy designed without answering these questions risks either under-imputing (discarding recoverable signal) or over-imputing (fabricating data in regions where recovery is not possible). The five analyses below provide the empirical basis for each design decision in the pipeline that follows.\n\n2.3.1 Co-missingness Structure\n\n\nShow the code\nhigh_miss_cols &lt;- c(\"sunshine\", \"evaporation\", \"cloud3pm\", \"cloud9am\")\nhigh_miss &lt;- high_miss_cols[high_miss_cols %in% names(df)]\n\ncat(\"High missingness variables:\", paste(high_miss, collapse = \", \"), \"\\n\\n\")\n\n\n#&gt; High missingness variables: sunshine, evaporation, cloud3pm, cloud9am\n\n\nShow the code\nmiss_mat &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(high_miss)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), is.na)) %&gt;%\n  as.matrix() %&gt;%\n  apply(2, as.integer)\n\nintersection_matrix &lt;- crossprod(miss_mat)\ntotal_miss_counts &lt;- diag(intersection_matrix)\n\npct_matrix &lt;- intersection_matrix / total_miss_counts * 100\n\nco_missing_stats &lt;- as.data.frame(as.table(pct_matrix)) %&gt;%\n  rename(var1 = Var1, var2 = Var2, pct_co_miss = Freq) %&gt;%\n  filter(var1 != var2) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pct_co_miss))\n\nco_missing_stats %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    msg = glue(\n      \"  {var1} -&gt; {var2}: {round(pct_co_miss, 1)}%  (when {var1} is missing, {var2} is missing)\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  pull(msg) %&gt;%\n  walk(cat, \"\\n\")\n\n\n#&gt;   evaporation -&gt; sunshine: 93.2%  (when evaporation is missing, sunshine is missing) \n#&gt;   cloud9am -&gt; cloud3pm: 92.6%  (when cloud9am is missing, cloud3pm is missing) \n#&gt;   cloud3pm -&gt; cloud9am: 87.2%  (when cloud3pm is missing, cloud9am is missing) \n#&gt;   cloud9am -&gt; sunshine: 84.3%  (when cloud9am is missing, sunshine is missing) \n#&gt;   sunshine -&gt; evaporation: 83.8%  (when sunshine is missing, evaporation is missing) \n#&gt;   cloud3pm -&gt; sunshine: 82.5%  (when cloud3pm is missing, sunshine is missing) \n#&gt;   cloud9am -&gt; evaporation: 81.4%  (when cloud9am is missing, evaporation is missing) \n#&gt;   cloud3pm -&gt; evaporation: 78%  (when cloud3pm is missing, evaporation is missing) \n#&gt;   evaporation -&gt; cloud3pm: 73.7%  (when evaporation is missing, cloud3pm is missing) \n#&gt;   evaporation -&gt; cloud9am: 72.5%  (when evaporation is missing, cloud9am is missing) \n#&gt;   sunshine -&gt; cloud3pm: 70.1%  (when sunshine is missing, cloud3pm is missing) \n#&gt;   sunshine -&gt; cloud9am: 67.5%  (when sunshine is missing, cloud9am is missing)\n\n\nShow the code\nco_missing_stats %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Conditional Co-missingness:\n              when var1 is missing, what percentage of the time is var2 also missing?\",\n    digits = 1,\n    col.names = c(\"Variable 1 (Missing)\", \"Variable 2\", \"Co-missing (%)\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Conditional Co-missingness Matrix\n\n\n\n\nConditional Co-missingness: when var1 is missing, what percentage of the time is var2 also missing?\n\n\nVariable 1 (Missing)\nVariable 2\nCo-missing (%)\n\n\n\n\nevaporation\nsunshine\n93.2\n\n\ncloud9am\ncloud3pm\n92.6\n\n\ncloud3pm\ncloud9am\n87.2\n\n\ncloud9am\nsunshine\n84.3\n\n\nsunshine\nevaporation\n83.8\n\n\ncloud3pm\nsunshine\n82.5\n\n\ncloud9am\nevaporation\n81.4\n\n\ncloud3pm\nevaporation\n78.0\n\n\nevaporation\ncloud3pm\n73.7\n\n\nevaporation\ncloud9am\n72.5\n\n\nsunshine\ncloud3pm\n70.1\n\n\nsunshine\ncloud9am\n67.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe co-missingness matrix (Table 2.1) confirms that these four variables fail as a systematic cluster rather than independently. The dependencies are strongest between instrumental pairs: if evaporation is missing, there is a 93.2% probability that sunshine is also missing. Even the weakest relationship in the matrix (sunshine to cloud9am) retains a rate of 67.5%, which is nearly double what would be expected under random failure.\nUnder MCAR, the co-missing rates would be close to the marginal missingness rates of each variable, roughly 40 to 48%. Rates uniformly between 67% and 93% instead indicate a shared upstream cause: the instrumentation profile of each station. Sunshine recorders, evaporation pans, and cloud coverage sensors are deployed as a package, not individually. A station without one is very likely to lack the others. This is MNAR at the station level. The practical consequence for imputation is that treating the four variables as independently missing would be incorrect: their correlations when observed are available precisely because they fail together, and a multivariate imputation method that exploits those cross-variable relationships will outperform four separate univariate models.\n\n\n2.3.2 Temporal Structure and Structural Breaks\n\n\nShow the code\ntemporal_trend &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(month_floor = floor_date(date, \"month\")) %&gt;%\n  select(month_floor, any_of(high_miss)) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -month_floor,\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(month_floor, variable) %&gt;%\n  summarise(pct_missing = mean(is.na(value)) * 100, .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(\n  temporal_trend,\n  aes(x = month_floor, y = pct_missing)\n) +\n  geom_area(fill = \"grey80\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_line(colour = \"#2C7BB6\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 50,\n    linetype = \"dashed\",\n    colour = \"grey50\",\n    linewidth = 0.4\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  scale_x_date(\n    date_breaks = \"2 years\",\n    date_labels = \"%Y\",\n    expand = c(0.01, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(0, 100),\n    labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Temporal Structure of Missingness by Variable\",\n    subtitle = \"Step changes indicate structural data collection breaks\n                rather than random sensor failures\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Missing (%)\",\n    caption = \"Dashed line at 50%. Monthly aggregation.\"\n  ) +\n  report_theme +\n  theme(panel.spacing = unit(0.8, \"lines\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Timeline of systematic missingness across the four high-missingness variables. The stepped increases visible particularly in sunshine and evaporation indicate structural breaks in data collection rather than random sensor failures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe temporal analysis (Figure 2.1) confirms that missingness is not randomly distributed over time. The cloud cover variables maintain a roughly stable and high missingness rate across the observation window, consistent with a fixed set of stations never having recorded these measurements. The sunshine and evaporation variables show a distinct stepped pattern: missingness rises at specific breakpoints rather than fluctuating randomly, indicating that certain stations were decommissioned or that recording protocols changed at identifiable calendar dates.\nThis temporal structure has a direct implication for the interpolation stage of the pipeline. Linear interpolation is appropriate when a smooth trajectory can be inferred from values on either side of a gap. Extended contiguous gaps produced by a structural break have no valid upper boundary from which to interpolate, and filling them with temporal interpolation would create long synthetic sequences with no empirical anchor. The five-day interpolation cap set in Stage 1 of the pipeline is a direct response to this finding.\n\n\n2.3.3 Geographic Concentration: Ghost Sensor Identification\n\n\nShow the code\nGHOST_THRESHOLD &lt;- 0.90\n\nlocation_summary &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  naniar::miss_var_summary()\n\nghost_sensors &lt;- location_summary %&gt;%\n  filter(variable %in% high_miss, pct_miss &gt; GHOST_THRESHOLD * 100) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pct_miss))\n\nghost_sensors %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Ghost Sensor Instances: Location-Variable Pairs \n               with &gt;90% Missingness\",\n    digits = 1,\n    col.names = c(\"Location\", \"Variable\", \"Missing (n)\", \"Missing (%)\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nGhost Sensor Instances: Location-Variable Pairs with &gt;90% Missingness\n\n\nLocation\nVariable\nMissing (n)\nMissing (%)\n\n\n\n\nAlbury\nevaporation\n3040\n100\n\n\nAlbury\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nBadgerysCreek\nevaporation\n3009\n100\n\n\nBadgerysCreek\nsunshine\n3009\n100\n\n\nBadgerysCreek\ncloud9am\n3009\n100\n\n\nBadgerysCreek\ncloud3pm\n3009\n100\n\n\nNewcastle\nevaporation\n3039\n100\n\n\nNewcastle\nsunshine\n3039\n100\n\n\nNorahHead\nevaporation\n3004\n100\n\n\nNorahHead\nsunshine\n3004\n100\n\n\nNorahHead\ncloud9am\n3004\n100\n\n\nNorahHead\ncloud3pm\n3004\n100\n\n\nPenrith\nevaporation\n3039\n100\n\n\nPenrith\nsunshine\n3039\n100\n\n\nPenrith\ncloud9am\n3039\n100\n\n\nPenrith\ncloud3pm\n3039\n100\n\n\nRichmond\nsunshine\n3009\n100\n\n\nWollongong\nevaporation\n3040\n100\n\n\nWollongong\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nTuggeranong\nevaporation\n3039\n100\n\n\nTuggeranong\nsunshine\n3039\n100\n\n\nTuggeranong\ncloud9am\n3039\n100\n\n\nTuggeranong\ncloud3pm\n3039\n100\n\n\nMountGinini\nevaporation\n3040\n100\n\n\nMountGinini\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nMountGinini\ncloud9am\n3040\n100\n\n\nMountGinini\ncloud3pm\n3040\n100\n\n\nBallarat\nevaporation\n3040\n100\n\n\nBallarat\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nBendigo\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nNhil\nevaporation\n1578\n100\n\n\nNhil\nsunshine\n1578\n100\n\n\nNhil\ncloud9am\n1578\n100\n\n\nNhil\ncloud3pm\n1578\n100\n\n\nDartmoor\ncloud9am\n3009\n100\n\n\nDartmoor\ncloud3pm\n3009\n100\n\n\nGoldCoast\nevaporation\n3040\n100\n\n\nGoldCoast\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nGoldCoast\ncloud9am\n3040\n100\n\n\nGoldCoast\ncloud3pm\n3040\n100\n\n\nAdelaide\ncloud9am\n3193\n100\n\n\nAdelaide\ncloud3pm\n3193\n100\n\n\nWitchcliffe\nevaporation\n3009\n100\n\n\nWitchcliffe\nsunshine\n3009\n100\n\n\nWitchcliffe\ncloud9am\n3009\n100\n\n\nWitchcliffe\ncloud3pm\n3009\n100\n\n\nPearceRAAF\nevaporation\n3009\n100\n\n\nSalmonGums\nevaporation\n3001\n100\n\n\nSalmonGums\nsunshine\n3001\n100\n\n\nSalmonGums\ncloud9am\n3001\n100\n\n\nSalmonGums\ncloud3pm\n3001\n100\n\n\nWalpole\nevaporation\n3006\n100\n\n\nWalpole\nsunshine\n3006\n100\n\n\nWalpole\ncloud9am\n3006\n100\n\n\nWalpole\ncloud3pm\n3006\n100\n\n\nLaunceston\nsunshine\n3040\n100\n\n\nKatherine\nsunshine\n1578\n100\n\n\nUluru\nevaporation\n1578\n100\n\n\nUluru\nsunshine\n1578\n100\n\n\nLaunceston\nevaporation\n2899\n95.4\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ncat(sprintf(\n  \"\\nTotal ghost sensor instances identified: %d across %d locations\\n\",\n  nrow(ghost_sensors),\n  n_distinct(ghost_sensors$location)\n))\n\n\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Total ghost sensor instances identified: 60 across 22 locations\n\n\nThe location-level analysis identifies the specific station-variable pairs responsible for the bulk of the aggregate missingness. The top ten instances from the script output, all at exactly 100% missing, are as follows: Albury (evaporation, 3,040 observations; sunshine, 3,040), BadgerysCreek (evaporation, 3,009; sunshine, 3,009; cloud9am, 3,009; cloud3pm, 3,009), Newcastle (evaporation, 3,039; sunshine, 3,039), and NorahHead (evaporation, 3,004; sunshine, 3,004). At these stations, the instrument in question recorded a value on zero days across the entire observation window. These are not sensors experiencing intermittent failure; they are sensors that were never present or that were removed before the data collection period began.\nThe distinction between ghost sensors and ordinary missingness is consequential for imputation. For a gap of five to fifteen consecutive missing days, a Random Forest model can generate reasonable predictions by drawing on correlated variables at the same station and the same variable at nearby stations. For a gap spanning 3,000 or more consecutive observations, this extrapolation has no empirical support whatsoever: there is no observed value at that station and variable combination to anchor or validate the prediction. Values produced for these pairs would be statistically plausible by construction but would carry no physical information about what the instrument would have actually recorded. Ghost sensor pairs are identified before Stage 2 runs and flagged so that their imputed values can be treated with appropriate scepticism in downstream analysis.\n\n\n2.3.4 Weather-Conditionality of Sunshine Missingness\n\n\nShow the code\nif (all(c(\"rainfall\", \"sunshine\") %in% names(df))) {\n  weather_missing_stats &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(rainfall)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(is_rainy = if_else(rainfall &gt; 1, \"Rainy (&gt;1mm)\", \"Dry (&lt;=1mm)\")) %&gt;%\n    group_by(is_rainy) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n      n_obs = n(),\n      pct_sunshine_missing = mean(is.na(sunshine)) * 100,\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    )\n\n  weather_missing_stats %&gt;%\n    kable(\n      caption = \"Sunshine Missingness Rate by Daily Rainfall Status\",\n      digits = 1,\n      col.names = c(\"Day Type\", \"Observations (n)\", \"Sunshine Missing (%)\")\n    ) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE)\n}\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Sunshine Missingness Rate by Daily Rainfall Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay Type\nObservations (n)\nSunshine Missing (%)\n\n\n\n\nDry (&lt;=1mm)\n110319\n47.8\n\n\nRainy (&gt;1mm)\n31880\n47.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndf %&gt;%\n  naniar::bind_shadow() %&gt;%\n  filter(rainfall &gt; 0 & rainfall &lt; 50) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = rainfall, fill = sunshine_NA, colour = sunshine_NA)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.35, linewidth = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"!NA\" = \"#2C7BB6\", \"NA\" = \"#D7191C\"),\n    labels = c(\"!NA\" = \"Present\", \"NA\" = \"Missing\")\n  ) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    values = c(\"!NA\" = \"#2C7BB6\", \"NA\" = \"#D7191C\"),\n    labels = c(\"!NA\" = \"Present\", \"NA\" = \"Missing\"),\n    guide = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, 10), expand = c(0.01, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Sunshine Missingness is Not Rainfall-Conditional\",\n    subtitle = \"Rainfall distributions are near-identical whether sunshine data\n                is present or absent,\\nconfirming missingness is driven by station\n                instrumentation, not weather conditions\",\n    x = \"Daily Rainfall (mm)\",\n    y = \"Density\",\n    fill = \"Sunshine Data\",\n    caption = \"Restricted to rainfall &gt; 0 and &lt; 50 mm.

The near-identical distributions confirm that sunshine missingness is not weather-conditional: the same stations are missing sunshine on both dry and rainy days because the instrument was simply not installed, not because it failed during precipitation events.\n\n\n\n\n\nA specific concern when imputing a predictor variable is outcome-related missingness: if sunshine sensors failed more often on rainy days, then the imputed values would carry a directional signal about the target variable and could introduce bias into the training data.\nThe empirical test refutes this concern. The table output (Table 2.2) reports a sunshine missing rate of 47.8% on 110,319 dry days (rainfall at most 1 mm) and 47.2% on 31,880 rainy days (rainfall above 1 mm), a difference of 0.6 percentage points. The density plot (Figure 2.2) makes the same point visually: the distribution of rainfall amounts on days with missing sunshine and on days with present sunshine are indistinguishable across the full range from 0 to 50 mm. The slight visual offset in the figure reflects not a systematic pattern but the difference in the sizes of the two groups.\nSunshine missingness is station-conditional rather than weather-conditional. The same stations record missing sunshine on both dry and rainy days at nearly identical rates, because the instrument is absent from those stations entirely. This finding clears the imputation path: there is no outcome-related confound to correct for.\n\n\n2.3.5 Missing Pattern Structure\n\n\nShow the code\ndf %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(high_miss)) %&gt;%\n  naniar::miss_case_table() %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Distribution of Missing Variable Count per Observation\",\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Variables Missing (of 4)\",\n      \"Observations (n)\",\n      \"Percentage (%)\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nDistribution of Missing Variable Count per Observation\n\n\nVariables Missing (of 4)\nObservations (n)\nPercentage (%)\n\n\n\n\n0\n62566\n43.012512\n\n\n1\n10525\n7.235666\n\n\n2\n20376\n14.007975\n\n\n3\n11378\n7.822082\n\n\n4\n40615\n27.921765\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case-level output from the script reveals a strongly bimodal structure across five distinct patterns.

The two endpoint categories, zero missing and all four missing, together account for 70.9% of all observations.\nThe 27.9% with complete simultaneous missingness corresponds directly to the ghost sensor stations identified in Section 2.3.3. For these observations, no imputation is supportable and the values remain missing after the pipeline. The 43.0% with no missingness require no intervention. The substantive imputation work is concentrated in the remaining 29.1% across the three intermediate patterns, where partial instrumentation means that correlated predictors are available to inform the Random Forest estimates. The bimodal structure also confirms that the co-missingness finding is not a statistical artifact: observations genuinely tend to be fully instrumented or minimally instrumented, not randomly partially instrumented.",

    "section": "2.4 Imputation Pipeline",
    "text": "2.4 Imputation Pipeline\nThe diagnostic evidence from Section 2.3 motivates each design decision in the imputation pipeline. Missingness is station-level rather than weather-conditional (Section 2.3.4), temporally structured with extended contiguous gaps rather than random scatter (Section 2.3.2), and co-located across variables at the station level (Section 2.3.1). These properties rule out simple listwise deletion and mean imputation. They call for a pipeline that respects temporal continuity for smoothly-evolving variables, exploits cross-variable correlations for the structured variables, and declines to impute where the data is genuinely unrecoverable.\n\n2.4.1 Stage 1: Temporal Interpolation\nThe eight variables with smooth day-to-day trajectories minimum and maximum temperature, morning and afternoon temperature, morning and afternoon pressure, and morning and afternoon humidity are imputed via linear interpolation grouped by location, bounded by a five-day maximum gap. The five-day cap is set directly in response to the temporal structural break finding: gaps of up to five days lie within a regime where the values at both boundaries sufficiently constrain the trajectory, while longer gaps are associated with structural collection failures that interpolation cannot safely bridge.\n\n\n2.4.2 Stage 2: Multivariate Imputation via Predictive Mean Matching and Random Forest\nRemaining gaps in sunshine, evaporation, cloud9am, cloud3pm, and the three wind direction variables are addressed using mice with method assignments differentiated by variable type.\nThe four continuous atmospheric variables (sunshine, evaporation, cloud9am, cloud3pm) are imputed using predictive mean matching (PMM). PMM draws imputed values from a pool of observed donor observations whose predicted values are closest to the predicted value of the missing case, rather than using the model prediction directly. This has two practical advantages over a point-prediction method for these variables. First, PMM is constrained to return values that exist in the observed data, which enforces physical bounds without requiring explicit constraints. Second, the stochastic donor draw introduces genuine between-imputation variability, which is necessary for valid Rubin’s Rules variance decomposition downstream. Each variable is imputed from a physically motivated predictor set:\n\nCloud cover (cloud9am, cloud3pm) from morning and afternoon humidity, morning pressure, location, and month.\nSunshine from cloud cover at both observation times, maximum temperature, afternoon humidity, location, and month.\nEvaporation from wind gust speed, maximum temperature, afternoon humidity, sunshine, location, and month.\n\nThe three wind direction variables (wind_gust_dir, wind_dir9am, wind_dir3pm) are imputed using Random Forest. Wind direction is a multi-class unordered categorical variable with sixteen compass-point levels. PMM is not appropriate for unordered factors because it imposes an implicit numeric ordering on the donor matching step. Random Forest handles the multi-class non-ordinal structure natively by splitting on class membership rather than on numeric distance. Each wind direction variable is conditioned on its temporally matched wind speed and pressure readings: gust direction from gust speed and afternoon pressure, morning direction from morning speed and morning pressure, and afternoon direction from afternoon speed and afternoon pressure. This preserves the physical coupling between concurrent wind speed and direction measurements.\nThe use of targeted predictor sets for all variables is motivated directly by the co-missingness finding in Section 2.3.1. Because the four atmospheric variables tend to be absent together at the station level, their cross-variable correlations when observed are strong and reliable signals for imputation. Restricting each variable’s predictor set to physically motivated covariates exploits this structure while reducing the risk of imputing on spurious correlations introduced by including variables that carry no physical relationship to the target.\n\n\n2.4.3 Ghost Sensor Flagging\nBefore Stage 2 runs, all station-variable pairs identified in Section 2.3.3 as ghost sensors (more than 90% missing across the full observation window) are catalogued and binary missingness flags are attached to the data (sunshine_imp_flagged, evap_imp_flagged, cloud3pm_imp_flagged, cloud9am_imp_flagged). These flags serve two purposes: they are excluded from the MICE predictor matrix so they cannot contaminate the imputation model, and they remain in the final dataset as explicit markers of which values are extrapolated with no empirical anchor at the station level. The raw date column is also excluded from the predictor matrix to prevent temporal data leakage. Neither PMM nor Random Forest has empirical support for predicting values at a station where an instrument was never present; the flags make this provenance transparent for any downstream analysis that needs to account for it.\n\n\nShow the code\nclean_and_impute_weather &lt;- function(df) {\n  MAXGAP &lt;- 5\n  GHOST_THRESHOLD &lt;- 0.90\n  M &lt;- 10\n\n  df &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    clean_names() %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      date = as.Date(date),\n      month = as.factor(month(date)),\n      day = as.factor(wday(date, label = TRUE)),\n      day_of_year = yday(date),\n      wind_gust_dir = as.factor(wind_gust_dir),\n      wind_dir9am = as.factor(wind_dir9am),\n      wind_dir3pm = as.factor(wind_dir3pm),\n      rain_today = as.factor(rain_today),\n      location = as.factor(location)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(rainfall)) %&gt;%\n    select(-rain_tomorrow)\n\n  # Interpolation\n  interp_vars &lt;- c(\n    \"min_temp\",\n    \"max_temp\",\n    \"temp9am\",\n    \"temp3pm\",\n    \"pressure9am\",\n    \"pressure3pm\",\n    \"humidity9am\",\n    \"humidity3pm\"\n  )\n\n  df_interp &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    group_by(location) %&gt;%\n    arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    mutate(across(\n      all_of(interp_vars),\n      ~ na.approx(., maxgap = MAXGAP, na.rm = FALSE, rule = 1)\n    )) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n\n  # Flag ghost vars\n  ghost_prone_vars &lt;- c(\"sunshine\", \"evaporation\", \"cloud3pm\", \"cloud9am\")\n\n  ghost_pairs &lt;- df_interp %&gt;%\n    select(location, all_of(ghost_prone_vars)) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(\n      cols = all_of(ghost_prone_vars),\n      names_to = \"variable\",\n      values_to = \"value\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    group_by(location, variable) %&gt;%\n    summarise(miss_rate = mean(is.na(value)) * 100, .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n    filter(miss_rate &gt;

    "text": "2.5 Post-Imputation Dataset Properties\nThe two-stage pipeline produces a dataset whose properties are each traceable to a specific finding from the diagnostic analysis in Section 2.3.\nRetention without fabrication. No observations are discarded on the basis of partial missingness. The 27.9% of observations with all four target variables simultaneously absent are retained with those variables still missing, consistent with the ghost sensor finding that no empirically supportable imputation is possible for them.\nTemporal coherence. The interpolated variables maintain their within-location autocorrelation structure. The five-day cap, set in response to the temporal structural break analysis in Section 2.3.2, prevents the interpolation from extending across genuine data voids. The use of rule = 1 in na.approx ensures that boundary gaps return NA rather than extrapolated values, which would fall outside the physically credible range of the variable and corrupt the donor pool used by PMM in Stage 2.\nDistributional fidelity. PMM draws imputed values directly from the pool of observed donor observations rather than using a model prediction. This constrains imputed values to the observed empirical range of each variable and preserves the marginal distribution, including multi-modal structure and skew, without requiring distributional assumptions.\nPhysical bounds enforcement. Because PMM can only return values that exist in the observed data, imputed values for all continuous variables are guaranteed to fall within the range of the observed training set. This property eliminated the out-of-range predictions that arose when rule = 2 extrapolation in Stage 1 produced boundary values below zero for sunshine, which then contaminated the PMM donor matching step.\nOutcome independence. The weather-conditionality test in Section 2.3.4 confirmed that sunshine missingness does not covary with rainfall amounts. Imputed sunshine values therefore do not introduce a directional bias into the training labels for the hurdle or intensity components of the downstream model.\nWind direction coherence. Wind direction variables are imputed as unordered categorical factors using Random Forest, with each direction variable conditioned on its temporally matched speed and pressure readings. This preserves the physical coupling between concurrent wind speed and direction measurements while respecting the non-ordinal structure of compass-point categories, which PMM would handle incorrectly.\nProvenance transparency. Binary imputation flags for the four ghost-prone variables are retained in the final dataset. These flags enable downstream models or diagnostics to condition on or exclude observations where imputed values carry no empirical anchor at the station level, and they are used directly in the sensitivity analysis documented in Section 2.6.",

    "section": "3.2 Data Quality Summary",
    "text": "3.2 Data Quality Summary\nA thorough investigation of missingness is documented in Chapter 2 and summarised briefly here for continuity. The full diagnostic pipeline, comprising co-missingness analysis, temporal structural break detection, ghost sensor identification, and a weather-conditionality test, established the following picture.\nThe dataset contains 314,146 missing entries in total, distributed highly unevenly across features. The four most affected variables are sunshine (47.7% missing), evaporation (42.5%), cloud9am (approximately 40%), and cloud3pm (approximately 37%). Their missingness is not independent: co-missing rates between any pair of these four variables range from 67% to 93%, confirming that they fail together at the station level rather than through separate independent sensor faults. This is Missing Not At Random at the station level, driven by instrumentation deployment profiles.\nA weather-conditionality test confirmed that sunshine missingness does not covary with rainfall amounts: the missing rate is 47.8% on dry days and 47.2% on rainy days. Missingness is station-conditional rather than outcome-conditional, meaning imputed values do not introduce directional bias into the training labels.\nThe core dynamic variables, pressure, wind speed, temperature, and humidity, exhibit missingness below 10% and are available across virtually all observations.\n\n\nShow the code\ntotal_na &lt;- sum(is.na(df_clean))\nprint(paste(\"Total missing values:\", total_na))\n\n\n#&gt; [1] \"Total missing values: 314146\"\n\n\nShow the code\nmissing_val(df_clean)\n\n\n\nPercentage of Missing Values by Feature\n\n\nFeature\nMissing (%)\n\n\n\n\nsunshine\n47.69\n\n\nevaporation\n42.54\n\n\ncloud3pm\n40.00\n\n\ncloud9am\n37.50\n\n\npressure3pm\n9.84\n\n\npressure9am\n9.80\n\n\nwind_dir9am\n6.88\n\n\nwind_gust_dir\n6.84\n\n\nwind_gust_speed\n6.80\n\n\nwind_dir3pm\n2.67\n\n\nhumidity3pm\n2.55\n\n\ntemp3pm\n1.93\n\n\nwind_speed3pm\n1.86\n\n\nhumidity9am\n1.09\n\n\nrain_tomorrow\n0.99\n\n\nwind_speed9am\n0.77\n\n\ntemp9am\n0.48\n\n\nmin_temp\n0.34\n\n\nmax_temp\n0.33\n\n\ndate\n0.00\n\n\nlocation\n0.00\n\n\nrainfall\n0.00\n\n\nrain_today\n0.00\n\n\nmonth\n0.00\n\n\nday\n0.00\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution. A two-stage hybrid imputation pipeline was applied in Chapter 2. Stage 1 applied linear temporal interpolation, bounded by a five-day gap cap, to eight smoothly-evolving meteorological variables: minimum and maximum temperature, morning and afternoon temperature, morning and afternoon pressure, and morning and afternoon humidity. Stage 2 addressed the remaining missingness using mice with method assignments differentiated by variable type. The four continuous atmospheric variables (sunshine, evaporation, cloud9am, cloud3pm) were imputed via predictive mean matching, which constrains imputed draws to the empirically observed range of each variable and preserves marginal distributional shape without imposing parametric assumptions. The three wind direction variables (wind_gust_dir, wind_dir9am, wind_dir3pm) were imputed using Random Forest, which handles their unordered sixteen-level factor structure natively without imposing a spurious numeric ordering on the donor matching step. Each variable’s predictor set was restricted to physically motivated covariates: cloud cover from humidity and pressure, sunshine from cloud cover and temperature, evaporation from wind speed, temperature, and humidity, and wind direction from the corresponding wind speed, pressure, location, and month. Ghost sensor station-variable pairs, those with more than 90% missingness across the full observation window, were identified before the Stage 2 run and carried forward with binary imputation flags (sunshine_imp_flagged, evap_imp_flagged, cloud3pm_imp_flagged, cloud9am_imp_flagged) rather than populated with extrapolations that have no empirical anchor. The imputed dataset df_final is used throughout the remainder of this chapter. The raw dataset df_clean is used only in this opening section, where using pre-imputation data avoids circularity between the imputed features and the response distribution.\nModelling implication. The concentration of missingness in sunshine and evaporation, both of which exhibit meaningful correlation with rainfall as shown in Section 3.4, creates a direct trade-off: discarding these variables avoids imputation complexity but sacrifices predictive signal, while listwise deletion would eliminate nearly half the dataset and introduce geographic bias toward well-instrumented stations. The predictive mean matching strategy in Chapter 2 resolves this trade-off by preserving both sample size and feature coverage, with distributional fidelity confirmed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics below 0.10 for all four variables.",

The median is zero. The data-generating mechanism produces two qualitatively different outcomes: no rain at all versus some positive amount. Any model treating the response as a single continuous variable will be forced to place probability mass on negative values and will systematically misestimate the probability of the zero outcome.\nHeavy tails. Among non-zero observations, the distribution is severely right-skewed (skewness = 9.84). The standard deviation (8.48 mm) is nearly four times the mean (2.36 mm). Kurtosis of 181.15 relative to 3 for a normal distribution confirms that extreme events occur far more frequently than a Gaussian model would predict. The maximum recorded value is 371 mm, and 151 events exceed 100 mm.\nModelling implication. The conjunction of zero-inflation and extreme positive skew means a single-component model is insufficient. The data implicitly poses two separate questions: does rain occur, and given that it does, how much falls? This motivates the Zero-Inflated Gamma framework adopted in subsequent analysis.",

Humidity3pm (\\(r = 0.44\\)) and cloud cover (\\(r \\approx 0.37\\)) show the strongest positive associations. High afternoon humidity indicates that moisture has accumulated in the lower atmosphere over the course of the day. Cloud cover is both a physical precondition for rain and a consequence of the same atmospheric dynamics that produce it.\nRadiation and evaporation indicators (negative association). Sunshine (\\(r = -0.40\\)) and evaporation (\\(r = -0.31\\)) exhibit the strongest negative associations. Long sunshine hours proxy clear-sky, high-pressure conditions. High evaporation signals warm, dry, low-humidity surface conditions.\nMulticollinearity. The correlation heatmap (Figure 3.1) reveals substantial redundancy among predictors. pressure9am and pressure3pm share \\(r = 0.96\\), and the two temperature readings are similarly collinear. This directly motivates VIF-based feature selection in the feature engineering chapter.\nStatistical validation. Steiger’s Z-test comparing the two strongest opposing predictors yields \\(z \\approx 188.9\\), \\(p &lt; 2.2 \\times 10^{-16}\\). With \\(N &gt; 140{,}000\\), the p-value alone is uninformative; the Z-statistic magnitude confirms that the differential predictive strength is not a sampling artefact. Humidity and sunshine represent genuinely distinct physical forces operating in opposing directions.",

The distribution of wet days across the days of the week is approximately uniform, ranging from 13.8% to 14.7%. This near-uniformity is physically expected: atmospheric processes operate independently of the social calendar. The slight variation is consistent with sampling noise, suggesting Day carries little predictive information.\nAnnual cycle. June (10.7%) and July (10.3%) record the highest frequency of wet days, consistent with Southern Hemisphere winter frontal systems originating from the Southern Ocean. February (6.5%) and December (7.0%) record the lowest frequencies. The cross-tabulation confirms this seasonal signal is not an artefact of any particular day of the week. Month is therefore a legitimate predictor warranting explicit model inclusion.\n\n\n3.5.2 Day-to-Day Persistence: A Markov Chain Analysis\n\n\nShow the code\nmarkov_table &lt;- df_final %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(yesterday_rain = lag(rain_today)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(rain_today), !is.na(yesterday_rain)) %&gt;%\n  count(yesterday_rain, rain_today)\n\ncont_table &lt;- markov_table %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = rain_today, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  column_to_rownames(\"yesterday_rain\") %&gt;%\n  as.matrix()\n\nprint(cont_table)\n\n\n#&gt;        No   Yes\n#&gt; No  93231 17043\n#&gt; Yes 17047 14829\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nchi_result &lt;- chisq_test(as.table(cont_table))\ncramers_v &lt;- cramer_v(cont_table)\n\ncat(\"\\nEffect Size Interpretation\\n\")\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Effect Size Interpretation\ncat(sprintf(\"V = %.4f: \", cramers_v))\n#&gt; V = 0.3107:\n\nif (cramers_v &lt; 0.1) {\n  cat(\"Negligible Association\\n\")\n} else if (cramers_v &lt; 0.3) {\n  cat(\"Weak Association\\n\")\n} else if (cramers_v &lt; 0.5) {\n  cat(\"Moderate Association\\n\")\n} else {\n  cat(\"Strong Association\\n\")\n}\n#&gt; Moderate Association\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nmarkov_data &lt;- df_final %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(yesterday_rain = lag(rain_today)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(rain_today), !is.na(yesterday_rain))\n\nmarkov_plot_df &lt;- markov_data %&gt;%\n  count(yesterday_rain, rain_today) %&gt;%\n  group_by(yesterday_rain) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prob = n / sum(n)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    yesterday_label = paste0(\"Yesterday: \", yesterday_rain),\n    today_label = paste0(\"Today: \", rain_today)\n  )\n\nggplot(markov_plot_df, aes(x = yesterday_rain, y = rain_today, fill = prob)) +\n  geom_tile(colour = \"white\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = scales::percent(prob)),\n    colour = \"white\",\n    size = 7,\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(\n    colours = c(\"#D4E6F1\", \"#2471A3\", \"#154360\"),\n    values = c(0, 0.5, 1),\n    limits = c(0, 1),\n    labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1),\n    name = \"Transition\\nprobability\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Markov Chain: Daily Rain Persistence\",\n    subtitle = sprintf(\n      \"X\\u00b2 = %.0f, p &lt; 0.001, Cramer's V = %.3f (moderate association)\",\n      chi_result$statistic,\n      cramers_v\n    ),\n    x = \"Did it rain yesterday?\",\n    y = \"Did it rain today?\"\n  ) +\n  eda_theme +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Markov chain transition matrix.

Cramer’s V (\\(V \\approx 0.31\\)) confirms a moderate practical effect size.\nThe transition matrix (Figure 3.2) reveals an important asymmetry. When the previous day was dry, there is an 85% probability of remaining dry: high-pressure systems are persistent and self-reinforcing. When the previous day was wet, there is only a 47% probability of continued rain, meaning wet events are considerably more transient. This asymmetry has a direct atmospheric interpretation: anticyclonic systems can persist for days to weeks, while frontal systems typically pass through more quickly.\nrain_today (lagged one day) carries meaningful predictive signal, yet its modest effect size also demonstrates that autocorrelation alone is insufficient. The wet state is too transient for a persistence-only rule, and other meteorological covariates remain necessary.\n\n\n3.5.3 Dry Spell Dynamics and Temporal Decay\n\n\nShow the code\ndry_spell_data &lt;- df_final %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    did_rain_yesterday = lag(rainfall &gt; 0, default = FALSE),\n    dry_spell_id = cumsum(did_rain_yesterday)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(location, dry_spell_id) %&gt;%\n  mutate(days_since_rain = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(days_since_rain &lt;= 30) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rain_binary = as.numeric(rainfall &gt; 0))\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(\n  rain_binary ~ days_since_rain,\n  data = dry_spell_data,\n  family = binomial(link = \"logit\")\n)\n\nwald_test &lt;- aod::wald.test(\n  b = coef(logit_model),\n  Sigma = vcov(logit_model),\n  Terms = 2\n)\nor_results &lt;- tidy(logit_model, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  filter(term == \"days_since_rain\")\n\nprint(wald_test)\n#&gt; Wald test:\n#&gt; ----------\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Chi-squared test:\n#&gt; X2 = 8099.7, df = 1, P(&gt; X2) = 0.0\ncat(sprintf(\n  \"\\nFor each additional day without rain,\n    odds of rainfall decrease by %.1f%%\\n\",\n  (1 - or_results$estimate) * 100\n))\n#&gt; \n#&gt; For each additional day without rain,\n#&gt;     odds of rainfall decrease by 16.5%\ncat(sprintf(\n  \"95%% CI: [%.3f, %.3f]\\n\",\n  or_results$conf.low,\n  or_results$conf.high\n))\n#&gt; 95% CI: [0.831, 0.838]\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nlogit_spline &lt;- glm(\n  rain_binary ~ splines::ns(days_since_rain, df = 4),\n  data = dry_spell_data,\n  family = binomial\n)\n\nlrt_result &lt;- anova(logit_model, logit_spline, test = \"LRT\")\nprint(lrt_result)\n#&gt; Analysis of Deviance Table\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Model 1: rain_binary ~ days_since_rain\n#&gt; Model 2: rain_binary ~ splines::ns(days_since_rain, df = 4)\n#&gt;   Resid.

Points are empirical probabilities (plus or minus 95% CI); the dashed line and shaded band show the linear logistic model fit and its uncertainty. The steep initial decline followed by a plateau motivates a spline parameterisation rather than a linear logistic term.\n\n\n\n\n\nA logistic regression of daily rain occurrence on days_since_rain yields \\(OR = 0.835\\) (Wald \\(\\chi^2 \\approx 8{,}099\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)): each additional dry day reduces the odds of rainfall by approximately 16.5%. This is consistent with the progressive establishment of stable high-pressure ridges documented in the Markov analysis above.\nThe linear model is an approximation. A likelihood ratio test against a four-knot natural spline is highly significant (\\(\\chi^2 \\approx 7{,}678\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). The empirical pattern (Figure 3.3) shows rain probability falling sharply from approximately 48% on Day 1 to around 18% by Day 10, then plateauing in the 12 to 16% range through Days 15 to 30. The linear model underestimates the initial steepness and overestimates the long-drought decline rate. This rapid-then-gradual decay motivates a spline parameterisation of days_since_rain rather than a simple linear term.",

The suppressed diurnal pressure drop on rainy days (1.7 vs. 3.0 hPa) is a stronger discriminating signal than the absolute pressure baseline.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormality and Test Validity. Q-Q plots reveal modest tail deviations across all three pressure metrics, but with \\(N &gt; 140{,}000\\) the Central Limit Theorem ensures that sample means are asymptotically normal regardless of the underlying marginal distribution. Welch’s t-test is used throughout to avoid the equal-variance assumption, and Bonferroni-Holm correction is applied across the three comparisons.\nBaseline Pressure. Rainy days show significantly lower mean atmospheric pressure than dry days at both observation times. At 9:00 AM the difference is 2.9 hPa (1015.4 vs. 1018.3 hPa); at 3:00 PM it narrows to 1.6 hPa (1013.7 vs. 1015.3 hPa). Cohen’s \\(d\\) for these baseline measures ranges from 0.23 to 0.42, a small-to-medium effect. Lower absolute pressure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for rainfall: the overlap between the two distributions is substantial enough that pressure level alone cannot discriminate reliably between states.\nDiurnal Pressure Change. The stronger discriminating signal lies not in the baseline but in how pressure evolves across the day. On dry days, the standard daytime thermal low produces a mean pressure drop of 3.0 hPa from morning to afternoon. On rainy days this drop is suppressed to 1.6 hPa, because cloud cover reduces solar insolation and limits surface heating. Cohen’s \\(d = -0.49\\) for pressure_change exceeds the effect size of either absolute pressure reading, and the Welch t-statistic of \\(-73.4\\) is the largest in magnitude among all three metrics. The rate of pressure change across the day is therefore a more robust indicator of rainfall state than the morning or afternoon level in isolation, and it is entered as a primary derived feature in the engineering pipeline.",

This section investigates how much falls when it does.\nJanuary and February distributions are shifted systematically right of the global median: summer storms are considerably more intense when they arrive, even though they occur less frequently. June through August cluster left, representing lower but more consistent rainfall. February records the highest mean intensity per wet day at 10.1 mm, nearly double July’s 4.9 mm.\nSummer rainfall has a wide interquartile range and a pronounced right tail beyond 100 mm per day, reflecting episodic convective storms. Winter shows a narrower, more peaked distribution. Both the frequency variation (more rain in winter) and the intensity variation (heavier rain in summer) carry independent information, and a complete model must account for both dimensions.\nEncoding implication. Because the seasonal cycle is continuous, the transition from December to January is climatologically smooth, and treating Month as an unordered factor discards that proximity information. Cyclical encoding via sine and cosine transformations of the month number preserves the circular geometry of the annual cycle.\n\n\n3.7.2 Statistical Validation\n\n\nShow the code\nseasonal_data %&gt;%\n  select(season, rainfall) %&gt;%\n  group_by(season) %&gt;%\n  get_summary_stats(rainfall, type = \"mean_sd\") %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Descriptive Statistics of Rainfall Intensity by Season\",\n    col.names = c(\"Season\", \"Variable\", \"N (Events)\", \"Mean (mm)\", \"SD (mm)\"),\n    booktabs = TRUE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")\n  )\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Rainfall Intensity by Season\n\n\nSeason\nVariable\nN (Events)\nMean (mm)\nSD (mm)\n\n\n\n\nSummer\nrainfall\n10571\n9.070\n18.195\n\n\nAutumn\nrainfall\n13382\n6.667\n13.495\n\n\nWinter\nrainfall\n15402\n5.463\n9.809\n\n\nSpring\nrainfall\n11764\n5.651\n10.495\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nkw_result &lt;- kruskal_test(rainfall ~ season, data = seasonal_data)\nepsilon_sq &lt;- kruskal_effsize(rainfall ~ season, data = seasonal_data)\n\ntibble(\n  Test = \"Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test\",\n  `Chi-squared` = round(kw_result$statistic, 2),\n  df = kw_result$df,\n  `P-value` = scales::pvalue(kw_result$p, accuracy = 0.001),\n  `Effect Size` = round(epsilon_sq$effsize, 4),\n  Magnitude = as.character(epsilon_sq$magnitude)\n) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Statistical Significance of Seasonal Differences (Non-Parametric)\",\n    align = \"lccccr\",\n    booktabs = TRUE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"left\",\n    latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  add_footnote(\n    c(\"Effect size: Epsilon-squared.\", \"Alpha = 0.05\"),\n    notation = \"symbol\"\n  )\n\n\n\nStatistical Significance of Seasonal Differences (Non-Parametric)\n\n\nTest\nChi-squared\ndf\nP-value\nEffect Size\nMagnitude\n\n\n\n\nKruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test\n230.44\n3\n&lt;0.001\n0.0044\nsmall\n\n\n\n* Effect size: Epsilon-squared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n† Alpha = 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndunn_result &lt;- dunn_test(\n  rainfall ~ season,\n  data = seasonal_data,\n  p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\"\n)\n\ndunn_result %&gt;%\n  select(group1, group2, statistic, p.adj, p.adj.signif) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Dunn's Pairwise Comparison Test (Bonferroni Corrected)\",\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Group 1\",\n      \"Group 2\",\n      \"Z-Statistic\",\n      \"Adj.

Summer stands alone as the most intense season (\\(\\bar{x} = 9.1\\) mm, \\(p &lt; 0.001\\) vs. all others). Autumn and Spring are statistically indistinguishable (\\(p = 1.0\\)). Winter registers the lowest mean intensity (\\(\\bar{x} = 5.5\\) mm) and is statistically distinct from Spring (\\(p_\\text{adj} = 0.026\\)).",

Rain events concentrate tightly in the upper-left corner (high humidity, low sunshine), while dry days are dispersed broadly across the feature space. This structural asymmetry justifies a multiplicative interaction term in the model specification.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile individual correlation analysis in Section 3.4 identifies humidity and sunshine as primary predictors, a standard additive model assumes their effects on the log-odds of rainfall are independent. The bivariate density plots (Figure 3.10) test this assumption directly by visualising the joint distribution of these two features conditioned on the rainfall outcome.\nDry Day Structure. The feature space for dry days exhibits a concentrated region in the lower-right of the humidity-sunshine plane, where sunshine is moderate-to-high and afternoon humidity is low. This reflects the high-pressure suppression regimes documented in Section 3.5.2, where clear skies drive both elevated sunshine duration and suppressed humidity. Notably, this cluster occupies the structural opposite of the Rain Corner: while high humidity and low sunshine do occur individually on dry days, their joint occurrence is not where dry-day density concentrates. This confirms that neither variable in isolation is a reliable discriminator between outcomes; it is the specific combination that carries the predictive signal.\nThe Rain Corner. The rainy-day panel tells a structurally different story. Precipitation events concentrate tightly in the upper-left quadrant of the feature space, where afternoon humidity is high and sunshine hours are low simultaneously. This cluster, the “Rain Corner”, is not a feature of either variable’s marginal distribution: high humidity alone and low sunshine alone each occur on dry days with regularity. It is the joint occurrence that distinguishes the rainfall regime. The density mass that is dispersed broadly across the dry-day panel collapses into this single region when rain is present, a pattern that an additive model, which cannot represent conditional concentration of this kind, would be structurally unable to capture.\nModelling Implication. The asymmetry between the two panels confirms a genuine statistical interaction: the effect of humidity on rainfall probability is conditional on the level of sunshine, and vice versa. This justifies including a multiplicative interaction term (\\(\\text{Humidity3pm} \\times \\text{Sunshine}\\)) in the model specification, in addition to both main effects.",

    "text": "3.9 Summary and Modelling Implications\nThe preceding analyses characterise the dataset along six interconnected dimensions, each producing a specific modelling requirement.\nThe distributional structure of the target variable, 64% zeros, extreme positive skew, and kurtosis of 181, rules out any single-component Gaussian model. A two-part framework separating occurrence from intensity is the appropriate response.\nThe missingness analysis (documented in Chapter 2, summarised in Section 1 above) establishes that imputation is necessary to preserve both sample size and the predictive signal in sunshine and evaporation, and that the predictive mean matching procedure does not introduce outcome-related bias. Between-imputation Fraction of Missing Information values exceeding 0.30 for all four atmospheric variables mean that downstream models incorporating these predictors must be fitted across all ten completions and pooled via Rubin’s combining rules.\nThe correlation structure identifies humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, and evaporation as the strongest individual predictors, and flags severe multicollinearity among morning-afternoon pairs. VIF-based feature selection is required.\nThe temporal analyses establish that both the day-to-day Markov state and the cumulative dry spell duration carry predictive signal. Month should be cyclically encoded. The dry spell decay is non-linear and warrants a natural spline parameterisation of days_since_rain.\nThe pressure analysis identifies the diurnal pressure change as the more discriminating pressure-derived feature, with Cohen’s \\(d = -0.487\\) separating rainy from dry days more effectively than absolute pressure level.\nThe interaction analysis provides empirical justification for a \\(\\text{Humidity} \\times \\text{Sunshine}\\) interaction term, reflecting the physical reality that precipitation concentrates where high moisture and low solar radiation coincide in the Rain Corner of the feature space.",

    "text": "1.1 Why Standard Models Fail\nRainfall in Australia is a problem of statistical extremes. The continent experiences some of the most pronounced hydrological variability on Earth: years of crippling drought give way to sudden, widespread flooding, driven by large-scale climate oscillations including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. For any predictive model, this variability is not background noise to be absorbed but a central structural feature to be represented.\nThe core challenge is that precipitation data violates the assumptions of standard regression in three simultaneous ways, each of which requires a distinct methodological response. This report develops a framework that addresses all three, building from first principles through empirical analysis to a validated hierarchical model.\nEach of these violations is not merely a statistical inconvenience. Each reflects a physical property of the atmosphere: the discrete threshold between no-precipitation and precipitation conditions, the stochastic intensity of convective and frontal systems once that threshold is crossed, and the temporal persistence of synoptic weather regimes. A model that ignores these properties is not a simplification of the problem; it is a misspecification of it.",

    "text": "NoteThree Structural Violations in Australian Rainfall Data\n\n\n\nZero-inflation. Approximately 64% of daily observations record exactly zero rainfall. A Gaussian linear model fitted to this data is forced to place probability mass on negative values in order to fit the bulk of the distribution correctly, producing predictions that are physically impossible. This is not a problem of outliers or transformations; it is a consequence of the data-generating process having two qualitatively different states.\nHeavy right tail. When rain does fall, the distribution of daily amounts is severely right-skewed, with a kurtosis of 181 and a maximum recorded value of 371 mm. The variance is approximately sixteen times the square of the mean. Standard models that assume a symmetric or light-tailed error distribution will systematically underestimate both the probability and the magnitude of extreme events.\nTemporal dependence. Daily observations are not independent. Whether it rained yesterday is one of the strongest predictors of whether it will rain today, with a transition probability of 47% from wet to wet compared to only 15% from dry to wet. Any model that treats consecutive observations as exchangeable ignores a substantial and recoverable source of predictive information.",

    "text": "1.2 The Modelling Framework\nThis analysis uses a Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG) hierarchical model. The core innovation is to treat rainfall occurrence and rainfall intensity as two distinct sub-problems with separate linear predictors, linked through a shared observation mechanism.\nThe formal structure is as follows. For each observation \\(i\\), the model defines:\n\\[P(Y_i = 0) = \\pi_i + (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(0 \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi)\\]\n\\[P(Y_i = y) = (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(y \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi), \\quad y &gt; 0\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi_i = \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\) governs the probability of a structurally dry day, and \\(\\mu_i = \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\) governs the expected intensity given that rain falls. The two predictor vectors \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) are estimated separately, allowing the atmospheric conditions that trigger rain to differ from those that determine how much falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantWhy Not Tweedie?\n\n\n\nThe Tweedie distribution is a natural alternative for zero-inflated positive continuous data, using a compound Poisson-Gamma structure to accommodate zero values alongside a continuous positive component. It was evaluated here and rejected on empirical grounds. The exploratory analysis (see Chapter 3) demonstrates that the predictors of occurrence and the predictors of intensity are not the same: rain_yesterday and pressure_change operate primarily through the hurdle component, while wind vectors and the sunshine-humidity interaction drive the conditional intensity. A Tweedie model constrains both to share a single linear predictor, obscuring this physical distinction and reducing interpretability without improving fit.",

We implement a two-stage imputation strategy that combines linear temporal interpolation with multivariate Random Forest imputation via mice, using physically motivated predictor sets for each variable to fill these gaps while preserving both sample size and predictive signal.\nRepresent weather dynamics as continuous physical processes. Wind direction is circular, the annual cycle is periodic, and the joint effect of humidity and sunshine is non-linear. Standard encodings of these variables discard their structural properties. We develop features that preserve this geometry: orthogonal vector decomposition for wind direction, sine-cosine encoding for seasonality, and a mean-centred multiplicative term for the humidity-sunshine interaction.\nAccount for spatial heterogeneity. The relationship between atmospheric conditions and rainfall is not uniform across a continent as climatologically diverse as Australia. We introduce location-specific random effects that allow baseline rainfall levels and key covariate relationships to vary by station, without requiring a separate model for each location.\nValidate against the data-generating process, not just the mean. Standard accuracy metrics measure proximity to the observed mean but cannot detect distributional misspecification. We use simulation-based residual diagnostics to verify that the model replicates the full statistical distribution of Australian rainfall, including its zero-inflation rate, tail behaviour, and temporal independence structure.",

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nDaily rainfall in Australia presents a statistical problem that standard regression cannot solve. Across 142,199 observations spanning the continent, 64% of days record exactly zero precipitation. When rain does fall, the distribution is severely right-skewed with a kurtosis of 181 and a maximum single-day total of 371 mm. Consecutive days are not independent: the probability of rain is 47% given rain the previous day but only 15% given a dry antecedent. And the relationship between atmospheric conditions and rainfall varies fundamentally between a tropical monsoon station in Darwin and a semi-arid inland station in Nhil.\nEach of these properties is a violation of Ordinary Least Squares assumptions. None of them can be corrected by transformation or outlier removal. They reflect the physical structure of the atmosphere: a discrete threshold between dry and wet states, a stochastic intensity process once that threshold is crossed, strong synoptic-scale persistence, and a continent spanning three distinct climate zones. The modelling framework must be built around these properties, not despite them.\nThis project implements a Mixed-Effects Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG) model that treats rainfall as two linked but structurally separate processes. A logistic hurdle component estimates the probability that a given day is dry, conditional on the full atmospheric state. A Gamma intensity component estimates the expected rainfall volume given that rain falls. Separate predictor sets are estimated for each component, allowing the drivers of occurrence to differ from the drivers of intensity. Location-specific random effects accommodate the spatial heterogeneity that a pooled model cannot represent.",

The two most predictive meteorological variables, sunshine and evaporation, are missing in 47.7% and 42.5% of records respectively due to uneven instrument deployment across the station network. Standard listwise deletion would eliminate nearly half the dataset and introduce geographic bias toward well-resourced stations. A two-stage pipeline combining linear temporal interpolation with multivariate Random Forest imputation via mice recovers these observations while preserving the marginal distributions of the imputed variables. Ghost sensor station-variable pairs, those exceeding 90% missingness across the full observation window, are identified before imputation and carried forward with binary provenance flags rather than populated with extrapolations that have no empirical anchor.\nCircular wind vector decomposition. Wind direction is a circular variable: a bearing of 359 degrees and a bearing of 1 degree are separated by 2 degrees, not 358. A naive numeric encoding treats them as maximally distant and destroys the directional information. Each compass bearing is resolved into orthogonal North-South (\\(V\\)) and East-West (\\(U\\)) components via trigonometric projection, converting a discontinuous categorical variable into two continuous physical quantities that a linear model can interpret correctly.\nTemporal signal extraction. Raw daily rainfall observations conflate the underlying weather regime with high-frequency stochastic noise. Seven-day trailing moving averages reduce the standard deviation of rainfall by 56%, from 13.1 mm to 5.8 mm, suppressing this noise and capturing a “weekly wetness regime” feature that reflects the accumulated atmospheric state preceding each observation. All moving averages are lagged by one additional day before use as predictors to prevent data leakage.\nInteraction term construction. The bivariate density analysis identified a “Rain Corner”: rainfall concentrates almost exclusively when afternoon humidity exceeds approximately 50% and daily sunshine falls below approximately five hours simultaneously. A centered multiplicative interaction term (sunshine * humidity3pm, with both variables mean-centred before multiplication) formalises this threshold. Centring reduces the variance inflation factor of the interaction term to 1.25, confirming that the artificial collinearity typically introduced by interaction terms has been eliminated.\n\n\nTwo-component mixture model. The ZIG model separates the zero mass from the positive continuous component through a logistic hurdle and a Gamma intensity submodel. The two components have independent linear predictors, allowing the atmospheric conditions that determine whether rain falls to be estimated separately from those that determine how much falls. This separation is empirically motivated: rain_yesterday and pressure_change are the dominant predictors of occurrence; wind vectors and the humidity-sunshine interaction are the dominant predictors of intensity.\nHierarchical random effects structure. Location-specific random effects are specified as uncorrelated random intercepts and slopes: \\(\\text{diag}(1 + \\text{humidity} + \\text{persistence} \\mid \\text{location})\\). This allows the baseline rainfall level, the humidity-intensity relationship, and the persistence effect to vary across the 49 weather stations in the dataset, while sharing a common global mean. The diag() structure avoids the overparameterisation of a full unstructured random covariance matrix.\nNon-linear dry spell dynamics. The EDA demonstrated that the probability of rain returning after a dry spell decays in a “rapid-then-gradual” pattern: it falls steeply over the first ten days and then stabilises. A linear logistic term for days_since_rain underestimates the initial decay and overestimates the long-run decay. A four-degree-of-freedom natural spline, \\(ns(\\text{days\\_since\\_rain},\\, df = 4)\\), is used in the zero-inflation component to capture this non-linear structure.\nEstimation and diagnostics. All models are fitted via maximum likelihood using the Template Model Builder (glmmTMB). Residual adequacy is verified using DHARMa simulation-based diagnostics, which test the scaled residuals against the theoretical uniform distribution regardless of model family. The final model passes dispersion (\\(p = 0.36\\)), zero-inflation calibration (ratio = 1.00, \\(p = 0.976\\)), and temporal autocorrelation (\\(DW = 2.0533\\), \\(p = 0.1197\\)) tests.\n\n\nThermodynamic interaction threshold. Rainfall occurrence is not a linear function of humidity or sunshine in isolation. It is gated by their simultaneous occurrence in the “Rain Corner” of the bivariate feature space, quantified through a highly significant interaction term (\\(p &lt; 0.001\\)) that is stable across all model specifications.\nMarkovian persistence. Having rained the previous day reduces the odds of today being dry by 76%, making rain_yesterday the single strongest predictor in the zero-inflation component. Weather states exhibit asymmetric stickiness: dry states are self-reinforcing (85% dry-to-dry probability) while wet states are transient (47% wet-to-wet probability).\nDirectional wind dynamics. Southerly and westerly morning wind vectors are the primary directional drivers of rainfall intensity, reflecting the influence of Southern Ocean frontal systems and the mid-latitude westerlies. Morning wind direction is three to four times more informative than peak gust direction, indicating that the provenance of the air mass matters more than its local turbulence.\nSpatial heterogeneity. After controlling for all dynamic meteorological variables, approximately 10% of total rainfall variance is attributable to location-specific baseline differences captured by the random effects. Tropical Top End stations produce roughly 1.7 to 1.8 times the rainfall of an average station at identical atmospheric conditions; arid interior stations produce approximately half as much.\nClassification performance. The zero-inflation component achieves an AUC of 0.827 and an overall accuracy of 75.28% at the Youden-optimal threshold, with a conservative error profile that generates false alarms at twice the rate of missed events.",

Median lines confirm that the central tendency is stable across windows; the visible tail compression is purely a reduction in stochastic variance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density plots in Figure 4.1 make the smoothing effect immediately apparent. The raw daily distribution is severely right-skewed with a long tail reaching into the hundreds of millimetres, a consequence of the extreme kurtosis documented in Chapter 3. The 3-day moving average begins to suppress this variance, and the 7-day average produces a substantially more concentrated distribution whose peak is considerably higher and whose tails are dramatically shorter.\nQuantitatively (Figure 4.2), the standard deviation of rainfall intensity falls from 13.1 mm in the raw series to 5.8 mm under the 7-day average, a reduction of 56%. The ridgeline plot (Figure 4.3) confirms that this compression is not an artefact of the summary statistic: the entire shape of the distribution tightens, with the median remaining stable across windows while the spread narrows. The 7-day average can therefore be interpreted as a measure of the prevailing weekly wetness regime, a smoothed characterisation of whether the preceding week has been generally wet or dry rather than a reflection of any single day’s unpredictability.\n\n\n4.2.2 Multicollinearity Trade-off\n\n\nShow the code\ncor_data &lt;- ma_data %&gt;%\n  select(\n    rainfall,\n    rainfall_ma3,\n    rainfall_ma7,\n    humidity3pm,\n    humidity_ma3,\n    humidity_ma7\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cor(use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"spearman\") %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column(\"var1\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-var1, names_to = \"var2\", values_to = \"correlation\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    var1 = factor(\n      var1,\n      levels = c(\n        \"rainfall\",\n        \"rainfall_ma3\",\n        \"rainfall_ma7\",\n        \"humidity3pm\",\n        \"humidity_ma3\",\n        \"humidity_ma7\"\n      )\n    ),\n    var2 = factor(\n      var2,\n      levels = c(\n        \"rainfall\",\n        \"rainfall_ma3\",\n        \"rainfall_ma7\",\n        \"humidity3pm\",\n        \"humidity_ma3\",\n        \"humidity_ma7\"\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(cor_data, aes(var2, var1, fill = correlation)) +\n  geom_tile(colour = \"white\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f\", correlation)),\n    size = 3.2,\n    colour = \"grey15\",\n    fontface = \"plain\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = \"#2166AC\",\n    mid = \"white\",\n    high = \"#B2182B\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    limits = c(-1, 1),\n    name = \"Spearman\\nr\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Correlations: Raw Variables vs. Moving Averages\",\n    subtitle = \"High within-variable correlations warn of multicollinearity for linear model families.\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  feat_theme +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    legend.key.height = unit(1.1, \"cm\"),\n    legend.key.width = unit(0.4, \"cm\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Spearman correlations between raw rainfall and humidity variables and their moving average counterparts. The high within-variable correlations (upper-left and lower-right blocks) confirm that including multiple windows of the same variable in a linear model would produce a near-singular design matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe noise-reduction benefit of moving averages comes at a cost. As shown in Figure 4.4, the 3-day and 7-day humidity moving averages share a Spearman correlation of 0.89, and the equivalent rainfall moving averages are similarly collinear with each other and with the raw series. Including multiple moving average windows alongside their source variables in the same linear model would produce a near-singular design matrix, inflating coefficient standard errors and making the model numerically unstable.\nThis presents a choice between responsiveness and stability. The 3-day average reacts more quickly to changing conditions but retains more of the day-to-day variability. The 7-day average is more stable but slower to reflect recent changes in the weather regime. For linear model families such as logistic regression, only one window can be safely retained per variable; including both is not viable. For tree-based models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, this constraint does not apply, since these methods select among correlated features at each split rather than inverting the full covariance matrix. The moving average selection strategy therefore depends on the model family, a consideration that informs the variable selection carried out in the subsequent modelling chapter.",

Treating month as a standard integer (1 through 12) would incorrectly imply that January and December are maximally distant on the number line, when in reality they are climatologically adjacent. Treating it as an unordered factor imposes no such adjacency constraint but discards ordinal information entirely.\nThe appropriate solution is to represent the annual cycle as a point on the unit circle, decomposed into its sine and cosine components:\n\\[\\text{day\\_sin} = \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{day\\_of\\_year}}{365}\\right), \\quad \\text{day\\_cos} = \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{day\\_of\\_year}}{365}\\right)\\]\nTogether, these two features encode any day of the year as a unique coordinate on the unit circle. The distance between any two days in this space reflects their true circular proximity: the December-to-January transition corresponds to a small arc, not a large jump. The model can learn smooth seasonal effects directly from the geometry of this representation.\n\n\n4.3.2 Temporal Persistence Features\nThe Markov Chain analysis (Section 3.5.2) demonstrated that the previous day’s rain state carries a moderate but meaningful signal (\\(V \\approx 0.31\\)), and the dry spell analysis showed that the probability of rain decays in a non-linear pattern as dry spells lengthen. Three features capture these dynamics.\nrain_yesterday is a direct binary indicator of the previous day’s state, encoding the first-order Markov transition as a predictor. days_since_rain counts the number of consecutive dry days preceding the current observation, capturing the progressive stabilisation of dry conditions that the logistic regression and spline analysis identified. rainfall_ma7 and humidity_ma7 provide a smoothed weekly context for both the rainfall and moisture signals, lagged by one additional day beyond the rolling window to ensure that no same-day information is included when predicting today’s outcome.\nThe lagging step deserves emphasis. Without it, the 7-day moving average at time \\(t\\) includes the observation at time \\(t\\) itself, meaning a model trained on this feature would have access to the value it is trying to predict. This form of data leakage produces artificially optimistic training metrics that do not generalise to deployment, where future observations are unavailable by definition.\n\n\n4.3.3 Physical Interaction and Derived Indices\nThe bivariate density analysis (Section 3.8) identified a qualitative difference in the joint distribution of humidity and sunshine between rainy and dry days: rain occurs almost exclusively when afternoon humidity is high and sunshine hours are low simultaneously, the “Rain Corner” phenomenon. An additive model cannot represent this conditional structure; a multiplicative interaction term is required.\nPrior to computing the interaction, both sunshine and humidity3pm are mean-centred by subtracting their grand means. This is not merely a cosmetic step. When an interaction term is formed from un-centred variables, the resulting product is algebraically correlated with both main effects, inflating the VIF of all three terms and making their individual coefficients difficult to interpret. Centring removes this artificial correlation: the main effects then represent the effect of each variable at the average level of the other, and the interaction term represents the additional effect of their joint deviation from those averages. This is confirmed empirically in the VIF diagnostics in Section 3.\nBeyond the interaction term, five derived meteorological indices are constructed from physically motivated combinations of the available variables. The dewpoint temperatures at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM, computed from the Magnus approximation \\(T_d \\approx T - \\frac{100 - RH}{5}\\), represent the temperature at which the air would become saturated if cooled at constant pressure. The change in dewpoint across the day (dewpoint_change) measures whether the atmosphere is gaining or losing moisture over the course of the day, a signal not directly recoverable from temperature or humidity alone. The moisture_index encodes the combined effect of high humidity and limited solar exposure. The instability_index combines pressure deficit from the standard 1020 hPa baseline with humidity, approximating the atmospheric conditions that favour convective development. cloud_development captures upward cloud formation during the day, which the pressure analysis identified as a meaningful precursor to precipitation.\n\n\n4.3.4 Circular Wind Vector Decomposition\nWind direction is a circular variable: 360 degrees and 0 degrees represent the same direction (due North), yet a naive numeric encoding would treat them as maximally distant. This misrepresentation is particularly consequential for wind because the directional origin of an air mass carries meaningful physical content: moisture-laden northerly flows behave very differently from dry southerly flows in the Australian context.\nThe standard solution is to decompose each directional reading into orthogonal Cartesian components by projecting the wind vector onto the north-south and east-west axes:\n\\[U_{EW} = v \\cdot \\sin(\\theta), \\quad V_{NS} = v \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is wind speed (in km/h) and \\(\\theta\\) is the compass bearing in radians. The resulting U and V components are continuous and interpretable: a purely northerly wind of 20 km/h produces \\(V_{NS} = 20\\), \\(U_{EW} = 0\\); a purely easterly wind of the same speed produces \\(V_{NS} = 0\\), \\(U_{EW} = 20\\). This transformation is applied to both the peak gust and the 9:00 AM wind observations, yielding four wind component features in total.",

After constructing the full feature set, it is essential to verify that no predictor has become so collinear with the others that its coefficient in a linear model would be effectively unidentifiable. We use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for this diagnosis. The VIF for a given predictor quantifies how much its coefficient variance is inflated relative to what it would be in an orthogonal design: a VIF of \\(k\\) indicates that the standard error of that coefficient is \\(\\sqrt{k}\\) times larger than it would be if the predictor were uncorrelated with all others. Values above 10 are conventionally treated as indicating severe collinearity requiring remediation.\nCyclical and wind components. The day_sin, day_cos, gust_V_NS, and gust_U_EW features all show VIF values well below 3. This confirms that the decomposition strategies, sine/cosine for the annual cycle and U/V projection for wind direction, successfully converted circular variables into continuous representations without introducing redundancy. Each component carries information that is approximately orthogonal to its pair.\nInteraction stability. The sun_humid_interaction term has a VIF of 1.182, which is exceptionally low for a multiplicative interaction. Without mean-centring the constituent variables before multiplication, interaction terms routinely exhibit VIFs above 10 due to their algebraic overlap with the main effects. The observed value of 1.182 provides empirical confirmation that centring eliminated this artificial correlation, and that the interaction term is capturing a genuinely distinct dimension of the feature space, the joint Rain Corner structure identified in Section 3.8.\nElevated collinearity in humidity. The highest observed VIF is for humidity3pm at approximately 4.841. This is expected: humidity participates structurally in three of the derived features (moisture_index, instability_index, and sun_humid_interaction), and its 7-day moving average is also present in the feature set. A VIF of 5 lies below the conventional threshold of 10 for severe concern and is consistent with what the literature describes as moderate collinearity. The decision to retain humidity3pm despite this inflation is deliberate: it is the single strongest individual predictor of rainfall in the dataset (Spearman \\(r = 0.44\\), as established in Chapter 3), and removing it in favour of its derived aggregates would sacrifice the direct same-day atmospheric moisture signal for the sake of a marginal improvement in collinearity. For tree-based models, this trade-off does not arise, since these methods are not sensitive to multicollinearity by design.\nOverall assessment. The full engineered feature set is numerically stable for use in linear model families. No VIF exceeds the critical threshold of 10, and the majority of features show values below 3. The pipeline has successfully converted the raw meteorological signals into a representation that is both physically interpretable and statistically well-conditioned for the modelling stage.",

Convergence requires that the chain means and standard deviations stabilise across iterations and that parallel chains starting from different random seeds mix freely without directional drift. Sustained separation between chains or a monotonic trend in the mean across iterations would indicate that the algorithm has not reached a stable solution and that the number of iterations should be increased.\n\n\nShow the code\ntrace_vars &lt;- c(\"sunshine\", \"evaporation\", \"cloud9am\", \"cloud3pm\")\n\ncm &lt;- imp_mids$chainMean\ncv &lt;- imp_mids$chainVar\nn_iter &lt;- dim(cm)[2]\nn_chain &lt;- dim(cm)[3]\n\ntrace_df &lt;- map_dfr(trace_vars, function(var) {\n  map_dfr(seq_len(n_chain), function(i) {\n    mean_v &lt;- as.numeric(cm[var, , i])\n    sd_v &lt;- sqrt(pmax(as.numeric(cv[var, , i]), 0))\n    tibble(\n      variable = var,\n      chain = factor(i),\n      iteration = seq_len(n_iter),\n      mean_val = mean_v,\n      sd_val = sd_v\n    )\n  })\n}) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.nan(mean_val))\n\np_mean &lt;- ggplot(trace_df, aes(x = iteration, y = mean_val, colour = chain)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.6, alpha = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\", guide = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq_len(n_iter)) +\n  labs(y = \"Chain mean\", x = NULL, colour = \"Chain\") +\n  report_theme +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\np_sd &lt;- ggplot(trace_df, aes(x = iteration, y = sd_val, colour = chain)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.6, alpha = 0.8) +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 2) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\", guide = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq_len(n_iter)) +\n  labs(y = \"Chain SD\", x = \"Iteration\", colour = \"Chain\") +\n  report_theme\n\n(p_mean / p_sd) +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\") +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"MCMC Convergence Diagnostics\",\n    subtitle = \"Chain means (top) and standard deviations (bottom) across iterations\",\n    theme = theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 13),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, colour = \"grey40\")\n    )\n  ) &\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: MCMC trace plots for the four PMM-imputed variables. Each coloured line is one of the ten parallel chains; the upper panel tracks the chain mean and the lower panel tracks the chain standard deviation across five iterations. Chains that mix without trend indicate a stable imputation solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll four variables exhibit satisfactory convergence. The chains mix freely throughout and show no directional trend in either the mean or the standard deviation, confirming that five iterations were sufficient for the PMM models to reach a stable solution. The sunshine chains undergo a sharper adjustment between iterations one and two, consistent with the asymmetric bimodal structure of that variable’s observed distribution, but settle into stable mixing immediately afterward. This behaviour is expected: PMM must locate a donor pool within a distribution that has both a low-sunshine cluster and a high-sunshine cluster, and this requires slightly more initial adjustment than the unimodal cloud cover distributions. It is not evidence of non-convergence.\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Distributional Fidelity\nConvergence of the algorithm is necessary but not sufficient: the imputed values must also reproduce the marginal distribution of each variable as observed at instrumented stations. Distributional fidelity is assessed by comparing the density of observed values, drawn from non-flagged rows in df_final, against the density of imputed values drawn from flagged rows. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic \\(D\\) quantifies the maximum absolute distance between the two empirical cumulative distribution functions. Because the sample sizes involved exceed 60,000 observations per variable, all KS p-values are effectively zero by construction and the \\(D\\) statistic alone is the operative measure of practical divergence.\n\n\nShow the code\nfidelity_df &lt;- map_dfr(continuous_ghost_vars, function(var) {\n  flag &lt;- flag_map[[var]]\n  bind_rows(\n    df_final %&gt;%\n      filter(.data[[flag]] == 0, !is.na(.data[[var]])) %&gt;%\n      transmute(value = .data[[var]], source = \"Observed\", variable = var),\n    df_final %&gt;%\n      filter(.data[[flag]] == 1, !is.na(.data[[var]])) %&gt;%\n      transmute(value = .data[[var]], source = \"Imputed\", variable = var)\n  )\n})\n\nks_results &lt;- fidelity_df %&gt;%\n  group_by(variable) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    ks_stat = ks.test(\n      value[source == \"Observed\"],\n      value[source == \"Imputed\"]\n    )$statistic,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(label = sprintf(\"D = %.3f\", ks_stat))\n\nggplot(fidelity_df, aes(x = value, fill = source, colour = source)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.35, linewidth = 0.6) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = ks_results,\n    aes(label = label, x = Inf, y = Inf),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    hjust = 1.1,\n    vjust = 1.4,\n    size = 3.2,\n    colour = \"grey30\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Observed\" = \"#2C7BB6\", \"Imputed\" = \"#D7191C\")) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n    values = c(\"Observed\" = \"#2C7BB6\", \"Imputed\" = \"#D7191C\")\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distributional Fidelity: Observed vs. Imputed Values\",\n    subtitle = \"KS statistic D annotated per panel.

The statistic for cloud3pm (\\(D = 0.019\\)) is negligible, and cloud9am (\\(D = 0.051\\)) remains well within the small-shift range. Both multi-modal peaks in the cloud cover distributions are reproduced accurately by the imputed draws. evaporation and sunshine show small shifts (\\(D = 0.065\\) and \\(D = 0.074\\) respectively). These are attributable in part to the ghost sensor stations identified in Section 2.3.3: those stations have climatological profiles that differ systematically from the instrumented set, and PMM donor matching correctly reflects those differences rather than suppressing them. All imputed values respect the physical bounds of each variable, a consequence of switching na.approx from rule = 2 to rule = 1 in Stage 1, which eliminated the out-of-range boundary extrapolations that would otherwise contaminate the PMM donor pool.\n\n\n\n2.6.4 Between-Imputation Variance\nThe justification for retaining \\(m = 10\\) completed datasets rather than a single imputation rests on the magnitude of the between-imputation variance. If the ten completions agree closely across observations, a single-completion analysis would be adequate. If they diverge substantially, pooling is required to obtain valid standard errors. The ribbon plots below display the range of imputed values across all ten completions for each observation, sorted by the cross-completion mean, so that the width of the ribbon directly represents the seed-to-seed uncertainty at each quantile of the imputed distribution.\n\n\nShow the code\nall_completions &lt;- map_dfr(seq_len(M), function(m) {\n  complete(imp_mids, action = m) %&gt;%\n    select(all_of(trace_vars)) %&gt;%\n    mutate(imputation = factor(m), row_id = row_number())\n})\n\nribbon_df &lt;- all_completions %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = all_of(trace_vars),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(variable, row_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_val = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE),\n    min_val = min(value, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_val = max(value, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(variable, mean_val) %&gt;%\n  group_by(variable) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rank = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(ribbon_df, aes(x = rank)) +\n  geom_ribbon(\n    aes(ymin = min_val, ymax = max_val),\n    fill = \"#2C7BB6\",\n    alpha = 0.25\n  ) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = mean_val), colour = \"#2C7BB6\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = \"free\", ncol = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Between-Imputation Variance Across Ten Completions\",\n    subtitle = \"Ribbon spans the full range of imputed values;\n                line is the cross-completion mean.\",\n    x = \"Observation rank (ascending mean)\",\n    y = \"Imputed value\",\n    caption = paste0(\n      \"m = \",\n      M,\n      \" completions.

The ribbon plots reveal a characteristic stepped pattern in the mean line, a direct consequence of donor values being drawn from a finite set of integer okta levels rather than a continuous distribution. A notable feature of the cloud cover ribbons is that for a substantial proportion of observations the ribbon collapses to zero width, meaning all ten completions agreed on the same donor value. This stability coexists with periodic spikes in ribbon width at specific observation ranks, most plausibly corresponding to cases where predictor coverage was sparse and the PMM donor pool was ambiguous between adjacent okta levels. The median range of zero for both cloud variables confirms that this agreement is the typical rather than the exceptional case.\nsunshine and evaporation exhibit a different structure. Their mean ranges (3.470 and 2.318 respectively) are smaller in absolute terms than the cloud cover ranges but their CV of Range values are considerably higher (1.483 and 1.721). This dissociation between the mean and the coefficient of variation indicates that imputation uncertainty is not spread uniformly across the distribution: the ribbons are narrow across the bulk of observations but widen substantially in the right tail, where high-sunshine and high-evaporation events are rarer and the PMM donor pool is consequently thinner. For any given high-evaporation day, the spread between the most and least optimistic imputed values across the ten completions is disproportionately large relative to the average. This right-tail concentration of uncertainty is precisely the regime where downstream model coefficients are most sensitive to the choice of completion, making pooled inference particularly important for these two variables.\nTaken together, the non-zero mean ranges and the elevated CV values for sunshine and evaporation confirm that the data does not satisfy MCAR in the regions where uncertainty is highest. Using a single completed dataset would treat the seed-to-seed variability visible in the ribbon plots as if it did not exist, producing standard errors that are artificially narrow. This provides direct empirical justification for the Rubin’s Rules pooling strategy formalised in the following section.\n\n\n\n2.6.5 Rubin’s Rules Variance Decomposition\nThe Rubin variance decomposition provides a formal quantification of how much of the total estimator uncertainty is attributable to missingness rather than to ordinary sampling variation. For each variable, a linear model is fitted to each of the \\(m = 10\\) completed datasets using a physically motivated predictor set that mirrors the production imputation matrix. The within-imputation variance \\(W\\) is the average sampling variance across the ten fits; the between-imputation variance \\(B\\) captures the dispersion of coefficient estimates across the ten datasets. Total variance \\(T = W + (1 + 1/m)B\\) and the Fraction of Missing Information \\(\\text{FMI} = (B + B/m) / T\\) follow directly from Rubin (1987). Ghost sensor observations are excluded from these fits because their zero within-location variance causes numerical instability in the linear model; only anchored observations with empirical support are used.\n\n\nShow the code\nflag_map_rubin &lt;- c(\n  sunshine = \"sunshine_imp_flagged\",\n  evaporation = \"evap_imp_flagged\",\n  cloud9am = \"cloud9am_imp_flagged\",\n  cloud3pm = \"cloud3pm_imp_flagged\"\n)\n\nrubin_predictor_map &lt;- list(\n  sunshine = c(\"cloud9am\", \"cloud3pm\", \"max_temp\", \"humidity3pm\"),\n  evaporation = c(\"wind_gust_speed\", \"max_temp\", \"humidity3pm\"),\n  cloud9am = c(\"humidity9am\", \"pressure9am\", \"humidity3pm\"),\n  cloud3pm = c(\"humidity3pm\", \"pressure3pm\", \"humidity9am\")\n)\n\nrubin_results &lt;- map_dfr(continuous_ghost_vars, function(outcome) {\n  flag_col &lt;- flag_map_rubin[[outcome]]\n  preds &lt;- rubin_predictor_map[[outcome]]\n  available &lt;- intersect(preds, names(imp_mids$data))\n\n  if (length(available) == 0) {\n    return(NULL)\n  }\n\n  fml &lt;- as.formula(paste(outcome, \"~\", paste(available, collapse = \" + \")))\n\n  tryCatch(\n    {\n      fits &lt;- lapply(seq_len(imp_mids$m), function(m) {\n        df_m &lt;- complete(imp_mids, action = m) %&gt;%\n          filter(.data[[flag_col]] == 0L)\n        lm(fml, data = df_m)\n      })\n      pooled &lt;- pool(as.mira(fits))\n      pr &lt;- pooled$pooled %&gt;% filter(term == \"(Intercept)\")\n\n      tibble(\n        variable = outcome,\n        W = pr$ubar,\n        B = pr$b,\n        T_total = pr$t,\n        FMI = pr$fmi\n      )\n    },\n    error = function(e) {\n      message(\n        \"Rubin decomposition failed for \",\n        outcome,\n        \": \",\n        conditionMessage(e)\n      )\n      NULL\n    }\n  )\n})\n\nstopifnot(\n  \"All Rubin decompositions failed; check imp_mids structure\" = nrow(\n    rubin_results\n  ) &gt;\n    0\n)\n\nrubin_results %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    pct_between = B / T_total * 100,\n    fmi_class = case_when(\n      FMI &lt; 0.10 ~ \"Low; single completion adequate\",\n      FMI &lt; 0.30 ~ \"Moderate; pooling recommended\",\n      TRUE ~ \"High; pooling required\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    digits = 4,\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Variable\",\n      \"Within (W)\",\n      \"Between (B)\",\n      \"Total (T)\",\n      \"FMI\",\n      \"Between (%)\",\n      \"FMI Classification\"\n    ),\n    booktabs = TRUE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Rubin’s Rules variance decomposition for the four PMM-imputed variables.

For cloud9am the between-imputation variance \\(B\\) exceeds the within-imputation variance \\(W\\), meaning that uncertainty from the missing data mechanism is the dominant source of variability in the intercept estimate rather than sampling noise. sunshine and evaporation show FMI values in the 0.47 to 0.55 range, implying that roughly half of the total variance in downstream estimates involving these variables is attributable to missingness if only a single completed dataset is used. These FMI magnitudes are consistent with the right-tail volatility identified in Section 2.6.4: the observations where imputation uncertainty is highest are also the observations that exercise the tails of the coefficient distributions most strongly. The consequence for subsequent modelling is direct: all zero-inflated gamma model estimates that incorporate sunshine, evaporation, cloud9am, or cloud3pm as predictors must be fitted across all \\(m = 10\\) completions and pooled using Rubin’s combining rules before inference is drawn.\n\n\n\n2.6.6 Diagnostic Summary\n\n\nShow the code\ntibble(\n  diagnostic = c(\n    \"MCMC convergence (trace plots)\",\n    \"Distributional fidelity (KS test)\",\n    \"Between-imputation variance (ribbon plots)\",\n    \"Rubin FMI decomposition\"\n  ),\n  criterion = c(\n    \"Chains mix without directional trend across iterations\",\n    \"KS statistic D below 0.10 for all variables\",\n    \"Ribbon width consistent with acceptable seed-to-seed variation\",\n    \"FMI below 0.30 for variables used in downstream inference\"\n  ),\n  outcome = c(\n    \"Met; all chains converge within five iterations\",\n    \"Met for cloud cover;\n    small shift for sunshine and evaporation within tolerance\",\n    \"Material variance present;\n    uncertainty concentrated in right tail for sunshine and evaporation\",\n    \"Not met; FMI ranges from 0.33 to 0.57 across all four variables\"\n  ),\n  action = c(\n    \"No action required\",\n    \"Monitor sunshine and evaporation coefficients for sensitivity\",\n    \"Use all m = 10 completions in downstream models\",\n    \"Pool all zero-inflated gamma model estimates using Rubin's combining rules\"\n  )\n) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    col.names = c(\"Diagnostic\", \"Criterion\", \"Outcome\", \"Action\"),\n    booktabs = TRUE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  column_spec(4, italic = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.6: Summary of imputation sensitivity diagnostics.

    "section": "2.4 Imputation Pipeline",
    "text": "2.4 Imputation Pipeline\nThe diagnostic evidence from Section 2.3 motivates each design decision in the imputation pipeline. Missingness is station-level rather than weather-conditional (Section 2.3.4), temporally structured with extended contiguous gaps rather than random scatter (Section 2.3.2), and co-located across variables at the station level (Section 2.3.1). These properties rule out simple listwise deletion and mean imputation. They call for a pipeline that respects temporal continuity for smoothly-evolving variables, exploits cross-variable correlations for the structured variables, and declines to impute where the data is genuinely unrecoverable.\n\n2.4.1 Stage 1: Temporal Interpolation\nThe eight variables with smooth day-to-day trajectories minimum and maximum temperature, morning and afternoon temperature, morning and afternoon pressure, and morning and afternoon humidity are imputed via linear interpolation grouped by location, bounded by a five-day maximum gap. The five-day cap is set directly in response to the temporal structural break finding: gaps of up to five days lie within a regime where the values at both boundaries sufficiently constrain the trajectory, while longer gaps are associated with structural collection failures that interpolation cannot safely bridge.\n\n\n2.4.2 Stage 2: Multivariate Imputation via Predictive Mean Matching and Random Forest\nRemaining gaps in sunshine, evaporation, cloud9am, cloud3pm, and the three wind direction variables are addressed using mice with method assignments differentiated by variable type.\nThe four continuous atmospheric variables (sunshine, evaporation, cloud9am, cloud3pm) are imputed using predictive mean matching (PMM). PMM draws imputed values from a pool of observed donor observations whose predicted values are closest to the predicted value of the missing case, rather than using the model prediction directly. This has two practical advantages over a point-prediction method for these variables. First, PMM is constrained to return values that exist in the observed data, which enforces physical bounds without requiring explicit constraints. Second, the stochastic donor draw introduces genuine between-imputation variability, which is necessary for valid Rubin’s Rules variance decomposition downstream. Each variable is imputed from a physically motivated predictor set:\n\nCloud cover (cloud9am, cloud3pm) from morning and afternoon humidity, morning pressure, location, and month.\nSunshine from cloud cover at both observation times, maximum temperature, afternoon humidity, location, and month.\nEvaporation from wind gust speed, maximum temperature, afternoon humidity, sunshine, location, and month.\n\nThe three wind direction variables (wind_gust_dir, wind_dir9am, wind_dir3pm) are imputed using Random Forest. Wind direction is a multi-class unordered categorical variable with sixteen compass-point levels. PMM is not appropriate for unordered factors because it imposes an implicit numeric ordering on the donor matching step. Random Forest handles the multi-class non-ordinal structure natively by splitting on class membership rather than on numeric distance. Each wind direction variable is conditioned on its temporally matched wind speed and pressure readings: gust direction from gust speed and afternoon pressure, morning direction from morning speed and morning pressure, and afternoon direction from afternoon speed and afternoon pressure. This preserves the physical coupling between concurrent wind speed and direction measurements.\nThe use of targeted predictor sets for all variables is motivated directly by the co-missingness finding in Section 2.3.1. Because the four atmospheric variables tend to be absent together at the station level, their cross-variable correlations when observed are strong and reliable signals for imputation. Restricting each variable’s predictor set to physically motivated covariates exploits this structure while reducing the risk of imputing on spurious correlations introduced by including variables that carry no physical relationship to the target.\n\n\n2.4.3 Ghost Sensor Flagging\nBefore Stage 2 runs, all station-variable pairs identified in Section 2.3.3 as ghost sensors (more than 90% missing across the full observation window) are catalogued and binary missingness flags are attached to the data (sunshine_imp_flagged, evap_imp_flagged, cloud3pm_imp_flagged, cloud9am_imp_flagged). These flags serve two purposes: they are excluded from the MICE predictor matrix so they cannot contaminate the imputation model, and they remain in the final dataset as explicit markers of which values are extrapolated with no empirical anchor at the station level.

    "text": "5.2 Model Architecture\nA Zero-Inflated Gamma model is a two-component mixture. The first component, the zero-inflation submodel, is a logistic regression that estimates the probability of a structurally zero outcome, a dry day on which no precipitation occurs regardless of atmospheric conditions. The second component, the conditional intensity submodel, is a Gamma regression (with log link) that models the expected rainfall given that rain does fall. Together they answer the two questions identified in the Chapter 3: “Will it rain?” and “If so, how much?”\nFormally, for observation \\(i\\):\n\\[P(Y_i = 0) = \\pi_i + (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(0)\\] \\[P(Y_i = y) = (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(y \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi), \\quad y &gt; 0\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi_i = \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\) is the zero-inflation probability and \\(\\mu_i = \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\) is the conditional mean intensity. The two linear predictors, \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\), can include different sets of covariates, allowing predictors of occurrence to differ from predictors of intensity. All models were fitted using glmmTMB, which implements maximum likelihood estimation for this family via the Template Model Builder.\nProgressive model construction serves two purposes. It provides a transparent audit trail connecting each modelling decision to its empirical motivation. It also enables incremental comparison: each model can be evaluated against its predecessor to isolate the contribution of the newly added component.\n\n\nShow the code\nfit_and_pool &lt;- function(cond_formula, zi_formula, datasets, \n                         control = glmmTMBControl(), n_cores = 2L) {\n  \n  fits &lt;- parallel::mclapply(seq_along(datasets), function(i) {\n    glmmTMB(\n      formula   = cond_formula,\n      ziformula = zi_formula,\n      family    = ziGamma(link = \"log\"),\n      control   = control,\n      data      = datasets[[i]]\n    )\n  }, mc.cores = n_cores)\n  \n  # Check for errors from mclapply\n  errors &lt;- sapply(fits, inherits, \"try-error\")\n  if (any(errors)) {\n    warning(sprintf(\"%d model(s) failed to converge\", sum(errors)))\n    fits &lt;- fits[!errors]\n  }\n  \n  pooled &lt;- fits %&gt;%\n    mice::as.mira() %&gt;%\n    mice::pool()\n  \n  fit_stats &lt;- data.frame(\n    AIC    = mean(sapply(fits, AIC)),\n    BIC    = mean(sapply(fits, BIC)),\n    logLik = mean(sapply(fits, function(f) as.numeric(logLik(f))))\n  )\n  \n  list(\n    pooled    = summary(pooled, conf.int = TRUE),\n    fit_stats = fit_stats\n  )\n}",

Model 1 formalises these findings by introducing the four most physically direct atmospheric drivers into the conditional intensity submodel, and a subset of moisture indicators into the zero-inflation submodel.\nThe AIC falls from 461,669.7 to 422,630, a reduction of approximately 39069.7 points, the largest single improvement in the entire model sequence. This magnitude confirms that atmospheric moisture and pressure dynamics are not merely correlated with rainfall but are its fundamental predictive substrate.\nAll four predictors in the conditional model are highly significant (\\(p &lt; 2 \\times 10^{-16}\\)). The positive coefficients for humidity3pm (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.38\\)) and dewpoint_9am (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.38\\)) indicate that both relative saturation of the afternoon air and the absolute moisture content of the morning atmosphere independently increase rainfall intensity when rain does occur.\nThe zero-inflation submodel reveals a meaningful asymmetry between the two moisture variables. humidity3pm carries a coefficient of \\(-1.07\\): the negative sign reflects the logistic parameterisation, where larger values reduce the probability of a dry outcome, so higher humidity strongly increases the probability of rain. dewpoint_9am, by contrast, is not significant in the zero-inflation component (\\(p = 0.907\\)). This dissociation suggests that it is the relative saturation of the afternoon atmosphere that determines whether the threshold for precipitation is crossed, while the absolute morning moisture content shapes the intensity of rainfall once it occurs.",

The Markov Chain analysis (Section 3.5.2) demonstrated that yesterday’s rain state carries a moderate but practically significant effect (\\(V \\approx 0.31\\)), and the seasonal analysis confirmed that both frequency and intensity of rainfall follow a smooth annual cycle. Cyclical sine/cosine encoding enters the conditional model, while rain_yesterday, cloud_development, and pressure_change are added to the zero-inflation component.\nAIC falls to 406,826 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 15,804\\) relative to Model 1), confirming that temporal context when in the year and what happened the day before contributes substantial predictive information beyond the instantaneous atmospheric state.\nBoth seasonal components are highly significant, providing statistical confirmation of the cyclical pattern documented in the EDA(Chapter 3). The continuous circular encoding correctly captures the smooth transition between the winter trough and the summer peak rather than imposing an arbitrary step at the calendar year boundary.\nThe most striking result is the persistence coefficient. At \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{zi} = -1.42\\) in the zero-inflation component, it is the strongest predictor in the hurdle submodel across the entire model sequence.

This quantifies the asymmetric persistence documented in the Markov transition matrix wet states are more likely to continue than to terminate.",

The dry spell analysis (Section 3.5.3) demonstrated that rainfall probability decays as dry spells lengthen, and the moving average analysis showed that a 7-day smoothed signal substantially reduces the stochastic variance of the rainfall and humidity series. Model 3 introduces these medium-horizon history features into the conditional intensity submodel.\nThe improvement is AIC = 405,125 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 1,701\\) versus Model 2). This is smaller than the earlier gains, reflecting the natural diminishing returns of adding temporally redundant information once the most immediate history has been captured. The signal is nonetheless genuine.\nThe results reveal an interpretable separation between the roles of immediate and accumulated history. rain_yesterday in the conditional model (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.31\\), \\(e^{0.31} \\approx 1.36\\)) indicates that if it rained the previous day, today’s rainfall is approximately 36% more intense on average consistent with a persisting frontal system delivering successive events of comparable severity. rainfall_ma7 (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.13\\)) extends this logic to the weekly horizon: a wetter preceding week is associated with heavier current rainfall, suggesting that prolonged wet spells are symptomatic of deeper atmospheric systems rather than sequences of independent events.\nThe negative coefficient for humidity_ma7 (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.10\\)) warrants careful interpretation. Conditional on all other terms, a persistently humid preceding week is associated with slightly lower rainfall intensity. This likely reflects a distinction between two meteorological regimes: stratiform cloud systems, which sustain high background humidity without producing intense precipitation, versus convective systems, which generate intense episodic rainfall under conditions of rapid moisture change rather than steady elevated humidity.\nFinally, days_since_rain is not significant in the conditional intensity component (\\(p = 0.14\\)). The dry spell length predicts whether rain occurs, but once the model knows rain is occurring, the duration of the preceding drought provides no additional information about how much will fall. This reinforces the conceptual separation between the occurrence and intensity sub-processes.",

An additive model cannot represent this conditional structure. Model 4 introduces the multiplicative interaction term alongside the broader thermodynamic context from which it arises.\nAIC falls to 403,742 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 1,383\\) versus Model 3).\nThe sun_humid_interaction coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.07\\) is highly significant and physically interpretable. The negative sign indicates that the combination of high humidity and low sunshine which, after mean-centring, produces a large negative product, is associated with heavier rainfall. This formalises the “Rain Corner” structure: neither variable alone is sufficient, but their adverse conjunction under saturated, overcast conditions is where the most intense events concentrate.\nThe entry of the interaction term also produces a marked reduction in the humidity3pm coefficient, from 0.39 in Model 3 to 0.16 in Model 4. This is not a loss of importance. It reflects a correct partitioning of explained variance: the portion of humidity’s effect that operates through its interaction with sunshine, and through the derived instability_index, is now carried by those terms. The model has moved from knowing that humidity matters to capturing the specific mechanism through which it matters.",

Wind direction is encoded as orthogonal U and V vector components, as developed in the feature engineering chapter, to preserve the circular geometry of directional data.\nAIC falls to 403,141 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 601\\) versus Model 4). The improvement is the smallest in the sequence, but given the large sample size and the physical plausibility of the effects, the additional wind information is retained.\nThe most informative coefficients are those for the 9:00 AM wind vectors. wind9am_V_NS (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.094\\)) is negative, indicating that southerly airflow increases rainfall intensity. This is consistent with the “Southerly Buster” phenomenon, in which cool moisture-laden air from the Southern Ocean penetrates northward along the eastern seaboard. wind9am_U_EW (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.073\\)) similarly indicates that westerly airflow increases intensity, consistent with the “Roaring Forties” the band of persistent westerly winds at southern latitudes that deliver moisture from the Indian Ocean.\nThe morning wind vectors have coefficients approximately three to four times larger than their peak gust counterparts. This confirms that the prevailing direction of the air mass at the start of the day reflecting the broader synoptic circulation pattern is more informative than turbulent gusts associated with active storm cells. The storm’s provenance matters more than its local expression.\nCoefficients for previously established predictors remain stable across this extension, confirming that the wind vectors explain variance genuinely unaccounted for by earlier components rather than displacing existing effects through collinearity.",

This homogeneity assumption is implausible for a continent as climatologically diverse as Australia.\nModel 6 relaxes it through a mixed-effects structure. Location-specific random effects allow the intercept and three scientifically motivated slopes; humidity, persistence, and dewpoint change to vary across weather stations. Uncorrelated random slopes (diag()) are used rather than a full unstructured covariance matrix, avoiding the overparameterisation that would accompany a freely estimated \\(4 \\times 4\\) random covariance structure across the number of locations in this dataset.\nTwo further additions accompany the move to mixed effects. The zero-inflation submodel is expanded with sunshine, evaporation, and the day-of-year cyclical components, reflecting the hypothesis that occurrence probability is also subject to the full range of atmospheric drivers. And days_since_rain in the zero-inflation submodel is replaced with a four-degree-of-freedom natural spline ns(days_since_rain, df = 4) directly implementing the “rapid-then-gradual” decay identified in the EDA (Chapter 3). The spline allows the probability of a dry spell ending to drop steeply in the first ten days and stabilise thereafter, rather than assuming a constant log-odds decrement per day.\nAIC falls to 396,638, an improvement of \\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 6,503\\) relative to Model 5. This is the second-largest single gain after the initial moisture predictors, establishing that spatial heterogeneity is a dominant source of unexplained variance in all the fixed-effects models. The random effects estimates confirm meaningful variability: the random intercept variance (\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 0.12\\)) captures substantial baseline differences in rainfall between locations; the humidity random slope variance (\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 0.023\\)) shows that humidity’s effect on intensity differs across the country; and the persistence random slope variance (\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 0.013\\)) indicates that the stickiness of wet weather is more pronounced in some climatic zones than others as one would expect contrasting the monsoonal north, where wet seasons persist for months, with the more variable climate of the southeast.\nThe fixed effects for global meteorological drivers; wind vectors, the instability index, and the sunshine-humidity interaction remain significant and directionally consistent with the preceding models. These are robust, continent-wide physical mechanisms whose effects persist even after allowing each location’s parameters to deviate from the global mean.",

Evaluating this component as a classifier allows us to assess how well the model separates the two fundamentally different weather states identified in the Chapter 3.\nDiscriminative ability. The area under the ROC curve is 0.827, meaning that in 82.7% of randomly drawn pairs consisting of one genuinely dry day and one genuinely wet day, the model correctly assigns the higher dryness probability to the dry day. This is a threshold-free measure of separation that does not depend on any particular operating point, and it indicates strong discriminative performance for a meteorological classification problem of this complexity.\nThreshold selection. The raw zero-inflation probability must be converted to a binary prediction through a threshold. Youden’s J statistic which maximises the sum of sensitivity and specificity simultaneously selects an optimal threshold of 0.6314. This is notably higher than the naive 0.5 default, and the reason is structural: because dry days constitute 64% of the sample, the model’s calibrated prior assigns moderate dryness probability to many observations by default. A higher threshold requires more decisive evidence of a dry signal before predicting “No Rain,” which appropriately reflects the prior imbalance in class frequencies.\nConfusion matrix. At this threshold, overall accuracy is 75.28%, decomposing into 69,365 correct dry-day predictions (true negatives), 37,422 correct rain predictions (true positives), 21,473 false alarms (predicted dry, actually wet), and 13,596 missed rain events (predicted wet, actually dry). The model generates false alarms at roughly twice the rate at which it misses rain events. In a meteorological context this asymmetry is operationally desirable: the consequence of carrying an umbrella on a dry day is trivial compared to the consequence of being unprepared for a significant rainfall event. A model biased toward caution is appropriate for this domain.",

Cities to the right of the dashed line produce systematically more rainfall than the national average when all dynamic weather variables are held constant; cities to the left produce systematically less.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random intercepts from the mixed-effects model represent the location-specific baseline deviations in rainfall intensity after removing the contribution of all dynamic weather variables, humidity, pressure, wind, seasonality, and persistence. What remains is the component of rainfall that is attributable to geographic and climatic factors that do not vary day-to-day: proximity to moisture sources, orographic effects, predominant circulation patterns, and regional climate regime.\nThe wetter locations. Katherine (\\(\\hat{b} = 0.54\\)) and Tuggeranong (\\(\\hat{b} = 0.57\\)) sit at the high end of the distribution. Exponentiating these values: \\(e^{0.54} \\approx 1.72\\) and \\(e^{0.57} \\approx 1.77\\), meaning that these stations produce roughly 72% and 77% more rainfall respectively than a hypothetical average Australian location experiencing identical instantaneous weather conditions. This is geographically coherent: both stations sit in the tropical Top End of the Northern Territory, where monsoonal systems deliver sustained and intense rainfall that has no structural analogue in the temperate south, and which the fixed-effects predictors measured on individual days cannot fully capture.\nThe drier locations. Nhil (\\(\\hat{b} = -0.66\\)) and Norfolk Island (\\(\\hat{b} = -0.72\\)) show the strongest negative adjustments. \\(e^{-0.66} \\approx 0.52\\), indicating that Nhil produces roughly half the rainfall of an average location given identical weather conditions. This reflects its position in the semi-arid Wimmera region of inland Victoria, where even moisture-laden air masses tend to deliver less precipitation than they would on the coast.\nJustification for the mixed-effects structure. The magnitude and geographic coherence of these deviations confirm the necessity of the random effects component. A pooled fixed-effects model would have suppressed this spatial variation by averaging across all locations, producing a single set of coefficients that systematically over-predicts rainfall in arid interior stations and under-predicts it in tropical ones. The mixed-effects structure allows the global physical relationships humidity drives intensity, southerly winds bring moisture, to remain stable as fixed effects while accommodating the fact that those relationships operate against a geographically variable baseline.",

DHARMa addresses this by generating a large number of simulated datasets from the fitted model and computing, for each observation, where the actual value falls in the empirical distribution of simulated values. Under a correctly specified model, these scaled residuals follow a uniform distribution on \\([0, 1]\\) regardless of the model family. Deviations from uniformity indicate misspecification.\nQ-Q plot. The empirical quantiles of the scaled residuals align closely with the theoretical diagonal across the full range of the distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test registers \\(p &lt; 0.05\\), but this outcome is expected and should not be interpreted as evidence of meaningful misfit: with \\(N &gt; 140,000\\) observations, the test has sufficient power to detect deviations of negligible practical magnitude. The visual alignment of the Q-Q plot the appropriate diagnostic at this sample size shows no systematic departure from the uniform reference.\nResiduals versus predicted. The three quantile lines (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the scaled residuals at each fitted value) are horizontal and evenly spaced across the range of predictions. This indicates the absence of systematic non-linearity (which would manifest as curvature in the 50th percentile line) and the absence of heteroscedasticity (which would manifest as convergence or divergence of the outer quantile lines). The model performs with equivalent fidelity across the full range of rainfall intensities, from light drizzle to extreme events.\nFormal test results. The dispersion test yields \\(p = 0.36\\), giving no evidence that the variance of the residuals deviates from what the fitted ZIG family implies. The zero-inflation test produces a ratio of observed to simulated zero counts of exactly 1.00 (\\(p = 0.976\\)), confirming that the model’s hurdle component is correctly calibrated and is neither over nor under-predicting the number of dry days in the sample. This last result is particularly notable: it means the 64% zero-inflation rate is not merely matched at the intercept level (as confirmed in the null model calibration check) but is correctly reproduced across the full conditional distribution of covariates.",

If the model has failed to capture all temporal structure in the data, residuals from consecutive days will be correlated, violating the assumption of independent errors and producing standard errors that are too small, confidence intervals that are too narrow, and significance tests that are anti-conservative.\nThis risk is particularly salient here. The raw data exhibits strong temporal autocorrelation: yesterday’s rain state, the weekly wetness trend, and the dry spell dynamics all create day-to-day dependencies that, if unmodelled, would produce heavily autocorrelated residuals. The model addresses this through multiple temporal mechanisms: the Markov persistence feature rain_yesterday, the 7-day moving average features, the natural spline of days_since_rain, and the cyclical seasonal encoding. The question is whether these collectively absorb the temporal signal or whether residual autocorrelation persists.\nThe Durbin-Watson test statistic is 2.0533. The theoretical value under perfect independence is exactly 2.0; values below 2 indicate positive autocorrelation and values above 2 indicate negative autocorrelation. A value of 2.04 is essentially indistinguishable from the ideal, and the associated p-value of 0.1197 gives no grounds to reject the null hypothesis of independence.\nThe ACF plot corroborates this: autocorrelation coefficients at all examined lags fall within the 95% confidence bounds, confirming the absence of any systematic periodic or decay structure in the residuals.\nThe interpretation is that the temporal engineering performed in the feature construction chapter was effective. By explicitly representing the day-to-day Markov structure, the medium-horizon wetness regime, and the non-linear dry spell decay, the model has absorbed the temporal dependence in the data and reduced its residuals to exchangeable noise. What remains unexplained is genuinely unpredictable from the available predictors, not the signature of an omitted temporal component.",

    "text": "6.6 Summary of Validation Results\nThe four validation procedures converge on a consistent picture of a well-specified model.\nThe occurrence submodel discriminates between dry and wet days with an AUC of 0.827, achieves 75.28% classification accuracy, and exhibits a conservative error profile appropriate for meteorological risk communication. The random effects structure captures geographically coherent spatial heterogeneity that a pooled model would suppress, with the tropical north and arid interior deviating from the national average by factors of approximately 1.8 and 0.5 respectively. The DHARMa diagnostics find no evidence of distributional misspecification, heteroscedasticity, over-dispersion, or miscalibrated zero-inflation. And the temporal autocorrelation test confirms that the model’s persistence and dry spell features have successfully eliminated serial dependence from the residuals.\nTaken together, these results support the conclusion that the final ZIG mixed-effects model is both statistically valid and physically well-grounded, a model whose structure reflects the actual mechanisms generating Australian rainfall rather than artefacts of the fitting procedure.",
