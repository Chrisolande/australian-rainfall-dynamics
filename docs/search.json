    "text": "Overview\nDaily rainfall in Australia presents a statistical problem that standard regression cannot solve. Across 142,199 observations spanning the continent, 64% of days record exactly zero precipitation. When rain does fall, the distribution is severely right-skewed with a kurtosis of 181 and a maximum single-day total of 371 mm. Consecutive days are not independent: the probability of rain is 47% given rain the previous day but only 15% given a dry antecedent. And the relationship between atmospheric conditions and rainfall varies fundamentally between a tropical monsoon station in Darwin and a semi-arid inland station in Nhil.\nEach of these properties is a violation of Ordinary Least Squares assumptions. None of them can be corrected by transformation or outlier removal. They reflect the physical structure of the atmosphere: a discrete threshold between dry and wet states, a stochastic intensity process once that threshold is crossed, strong synoptic-scale persistence, and a continent spanning three distinct climate zones. The modelling framework must be built around these properties, not despite them.\nThis project implements a Mixed-Effects Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG) model that treats rainfall as two linked but structurally separate processes. A logistic hurdle component estimates the probability that a given day is dry, conditional on the full atmospheric state. A Gamma intensity component estimates the expected rainfall volume given that rain falls. Separate predictor sets are estimated for each component, allowing the drivers of occurrence to differ from the drivers of intensity. Location-specific random effects accommodate the spatial heterogeneity that a pooled model cannot represent.",

The two most predictive meteorological variables, sunshine and evaporation, are missing in 47.7% and 42.5% of records respectively due to uneven instrument deployment across the station network. Standard listwise deletion would eliminate nearly half the dataset and introduce geographic bias toward well-resourced stations. A multi-stage pipeline combining temporal interpolation with Random Forest Predictive Mean Matching via missRanger recovers these observations while preserving the marginal distributions of the imputed variables.\nCircular wind vector decomposition. Wind direction is a circular variable: a bearing of 359 degrees and a bearing of 1 degree are separated by 2 degrees, not 358. A naive numeric encoding treats them as maximally distant and destroys the directional information. Each compass bearing is resolved into orthogonal North-South (\\(V\\)) and East-West (\\(U\\)) components via trigonometric projection, converting a discontinuous categorical variable into two continuous physical quantities that a linear model can interpret correctly.\nTemporal signal extraction. Raw daily rainfall observations conflate the underlying weather regime with high-frequency stochastic noise. Seven-day trailing moving averages reduce the standard deviation of rainfall by 56%, from 13.1 mm to 5.8 mm, suppressing this noise and capturing a “weekly wetness regime” feature that reflects the accumulated atmospheric state preceding each observation. All moving averages are lagged by one additional day before use as predictors to prevent data leakage.\nInteraction term construction. The bivariate density analysis identified a “Rain Corner”: rainfall concentrates almost exclusively when afternoon humidity exceeds approximately 50% and daily sunshine falls below approximately five hours simultaneously. A centered multiplicative interaction term (sunshine * humidity3pm, with both variables mean-centred before multiplication) formalises this threshold. Centring reduces the variance inflation factor of the interaction term to 1.25, confirming that the artificial collinearity typically introduced by interaction terms has been eliminated.\n\n\nTwo-component mixture model. The ZIG model separates the zero mass from the positive continuous component through a logistic hurdle and a Gamma intensity submodel. The two components have independent linear predictors, allowing the atmospheric conditions that determine whether rain falls to be estimated separately from those that determine how much falls. This separation is empirically motivated: rain_yesterday and pressure_change are the dominant predictors of occurrence; wind vectors and the humidity-sunshine interaction are the dominant predictors of intensity.\nHierarchical random effects structure. Location-specific random effects are specified as uncorrelated random intercepts and slopes: \\(\\text{diag}(1 + \\text{humidity} + \\text{persistence} \\mid \\text{location})\\). This allows the baseline rainfall level, the humidity-intensity relationship, and the persistence effect to vary across the 49 weather stations in the dataset, while sharing a common global mean. The diag() structure avoids the overparameterisation of a full unstructured random covariance matrix.\nNon-linear dry spell dynamics. The EDA demonstrated that the probability of rain returning after a dry spell decays in a “rapid-then-gradual” pattern: it falls steeply over the first ten days and then stabilises. A linear logistic term for days_since_rain underestimates the initial decay and overestimates the long-run decay. A four-degree-of-freedom natural spline, \\(ns(\\text{days\\_since\\_rain},\\, df = 4)\\), is used in the zero-inflation component to capture this non-linear structure.\nEstimation and diagnostics. All models are fitted via maximum likelihood using the Template Model Builder (glmmTMB). Residual adequacy is verified using DHARMa simulation-based diagnostics, which test the scaled residuals against the theoretical uniform distribution regardless of model family. The final model passes dispersion (\\(p = 0.36\\)), zero-inflation calibration (ratio = 1.00, \\(p = 0.976\\)), and temporal autocorrelation (\\(DW = 2.0533\\), \\(p = 0.1197\\)) tests.\n\n\nThermodynamic interaction threshold. Rainfall occurrence is not a linear function of humidity or sunshine in isolation. It is gated by their simultaneous occurrence in the “Rain Corner” of the bivariate feature space, quantified through a highly significant interaction term (\\(p &lt; 0.001\\)) that is stable across all model specifications.\nMarkovian persistence. Having rained the previous day reduces the odds of today being dry by 76%, making rain_yesterday the single strongest predictor in the zero-inflation component. Weather states exhibit asymmetric stickiness: dry states are self-reinforcing (85% dry-to-dry probability) while wet states are transient (47% wet-to-wet probability).\nDirectional wind dynamics. Southerly and westerly morning wind vectors are the primary directional drivers of rainfall intensity, reflecting the influence of Southern Ocean frontal systems and the mid-latitude westerlies. Morning wind direction is three to four times more informative than peak gust direction, indicating that the provenance of the air mass matters more than its local turbulence.\nSpatial heterogeneity. After controlling for all dynamic meteorological variables, approximately 10% of total rainfall variance is attributable to location-specific baseline differences captured by the random effects. Tropical Top End stations produce roughly 1.7 to 1.8 times the rainfall of an average station at identical atmospheric conditions; arid interior stations produce approximately half as much.\nClassification performance. The zero-inflation component achieves an AUC of 0.827 and an overall accuracy of 75.28% at the Youden-optimal threshold, with a conservative error profile that generates false alarms at twice the rate of missed events.",

    "text": "1.1 Why Standard Models Fail\nRainfall in Australia is a problem of statistical extremes. The continent experiences some of the most pronounced hydrological variability on Earth: years of crippling drought give way to sudden, widespread flooding, driven by large-scale climate oscillations including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. For any predictive model, this variability is not background noise to be absorbed but a central structural feature to be represented.\nThe core challenge is that precipitation data violates the assumptions of standard regression in three simultaneous ways, each of which requires a distinct methodological response. This report develops a framework that addresses all three, building from first principles through empirical analysis to a validated hierarchical model.\nEach of these violations is not merely a statistical inconvenience. Each reflects a physical property of the atmosphere: the discrete threshold between no-precipitation and precipitation conditions, the stochastic intensity of convective and frontal systems once that threshold is crossed, and the temporal persistence of synoptic weather regimes. A model that ignores these properties is not a simplification of the problem; it is a misspecification of it.",

This is not a problem of outliers or transformations; it is a consequence of the data-generating process having two qualitatively different states.\nHeavy right tail. When rain does fall, the distribution of daily amounts is severely right-skewed, with a kurtosis of 181 and a maximum recorded value of 371 mm. The variance is approximately sixteen times the square of the mean. Standard models that assume a symmetric or light-tailed error distribution will systematically underestimate both the probability and the magnitude of extreme events.\nTemporal dependence. Daily observations are not independent.

The core innovation is to treat rainfall occurrence and rainfall intensity as two distinct sub-problems with separate linear predictors, linked through a shared observation mechanism.\nThe formal structure is as follows. For each observation \\(i\\), the model defines:\n\\[P(Y_i = 0) = \\pi_i + (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(0 \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi)\\]\n\\[P(Y_i = y) = (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(y \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi), \\quad y &gt; 0\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi_i = \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\) governs the probability of a structurally dry day, and \\(\\mu_i = \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\) governs the expected intensity given that rain falls. The two predictor vectors \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) are estimated separately, allowing the atmospheric conditions that trigger rain to differ from those that determine how much falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Not Tweedie?\n\n\n\nThe Tweedie distribution is a natural alternative for zero-inflated positive continuous data, using a compound Poisson-Gamma structure to accommodate zero values alongside a continuous positive component. It was evaluated here and rejected on empirical grounds. The exploratory analysis (see Chapter 3) demonstrates that the predictors of occurrence and the predictors of intensity are not the same: rain_yesterday and pressure_change operate primarily through the hurdle component, while wind vectors and the sunshine-humidity interaction drive the conditional intensity. A Tweedie model constrains both to share a single linear predictor, obscuring this physical distinction and reducing interpretability without improving fit.",

We implement a three-stage imputation strategy that uses temporal neighbourhood, multivariate relationships, and domain-specific inference to fill these gaps, preserving both sample size and predictive signal.\nRepresent weather dynamics as continuous physical processes. Wind direction is circular, the annual cycle is periodic, and the joint effect of humidity and sunshine is non-linear. Standard encodings of these variables discard their structural properties. We develop features that preserve this geometry: orthogonal vector decomposition for wind direction, sine-cosine encoding for seasonality, and a mean-centred multiplicative term for the humidity-sunshine interaction.\nAccount for spatial heterogeneity. The relationship between atmospheric conditions and rainfall is not uniform across a continent as climatologically diverse as Australia. We introduce location-specific random effects that allow baseline rainfall levels and key covariate relationships to vary by station, without requiring a separate model for each location.\nValidate against the data-generating process, not just the mean. Standard accuracy metrics measure proximity to the observed mean but cannot detect distributional misspecification.

Standard mean or median imputation would fill the gaps but would shrink the marginal variance of the imputed variables and distort their correlations with other predictors.\nThe imputation pipeline described here addresses these problems through a three-stage strategy, each stage targeting a different structural type of missingness.\n\n2.3.1 Stage 1: Missingness Flags\nBefore any imputation takes place, binary indicator variables are created for the four variables with high missingness: sunshine_imp_flagged, evap_imp_flagged, cloud3pm_imp_flagged, and cloud9am_imp_flagged. A flag value of 1 indicates that the corresponding observation was subsequently imputed.\nThe motivation is that the pattern of missingness is not random with respect to atmospheric conditions. Sunshine sensors may fail more frequently during prolonged cloud cover or heavy rain, and evaporation pan measurements may be suspended during equipment maintenance that is itself weather-triggered. If missingness is informative in this way, the imputation flags allow the model to learn this association rather than treating the imputed and observed values as exchangeable.\n\n\n2.3.2 Stage 2: Temporal Interpolation\nThe eight variables with strong day-to-day persistence and smooth trajectories; minimum and maximum temperature, morning and afternoon temperature, morning and afternoon pressure, and morning and afternoon humidity are imputed via linear interpolation grouped by location. The interpolation is bounded by a maximum gap of five consecutive missing days.\nThe physical rationale is direct. Atmospheric temperature, pressure, and humidity evolve as continuous functions of time: a value of \\(20^\\circ\\)C on Monday and \\(22^\\circ\\)C on Wednesday implies a physically reasonable estimate of \\(21^\\circ\\)C on Tuesday. Filling this gap with a global mean or a seasonal climatology would ignore the temporal context that makes the missing value estimable with high confidence. The five-day cap prevents the interpolation from producing extended sequences of synthetic data over sustained sensor outages, which would introduce artificial smoothness into periods that may have been meteorologically volatile.\n\n\n2.3.3 Stage 3: Multivariate Random Forest Imputation\nThe remaining gaps, concentrated in sunshine, evaporation, and cloud cover, cannot be addressed by temporal interpolation because these variables do not exhibit simple smooth trajectories. Their behaviour is conditional on specific atmospheric configurations and their relationships to other predictors are non-linear.\nA two-pass approach is used. The first pass applies missRanger, iterative Random Forest imputation with Predictive Mean Matching across the dataset as a whole. PMM ensures that imputed values are drawn from the observed distribution of each variable rather than extrapolated from the regression surface, which preserves the marginal distributions and prevents the variance shrinkage associated with direct regression imputation.\nThe second pass applies targeted mice imputation using Random Forest as the imputation method, with scientifically motivated predictor sets for each variable. Cloud cover at 9 AM and 3 PM are predicted from humidity and pressure, which are the direct physical precursors of atmospheric stability and cloud formation. Sunshine duration is predicted from cloud cover and temperature, reflecting the inverse relationship between overcast conditions and insolation. Evaporation is predicted from wind speed, temperature, humidity, sunshine, and location, corresponding to the Penman-Monteith physical drivers of evaporative demand.\nUsing targeted predictors rather than allowing the algorithm to use all available variables serves two purposes: it reduces the risk of imputing on spurious correlations present in the training data but absent from the physical system, and it makes the imputation procedure interpretable and auditable.\n\n\n2.3.4 Ghost Sensor Detection\nSome stations in the network experience sustained equipment failures in which a specific sensor records no values for an entire season or longer. If these extended gaps are passed to the Random Forest imputer, the algorithm will produce synthetic values for the entire period using correlations with other variables from the same location. This is methodologically unsound: the correlations learned from the observed periods at that station may not hold during the failure period, and producing a long uninterrupted synthetic series could create artificial patterns that mislead downstream analysis.\nGhost sensors are identified as any location-variable pair where the missingness rate exceeds 90%. After the full imputation pipeline runs, values for these pairs are reverted to missing. This conservative treatment accepts that some data is genuinely unrecoverable, while allowing the imputation to work effectively on the shorter gaps that constitute recoverable missingness.\n\n\nCode\nclean_and_impute_weather &lt;- function(df) {\n  MAXGAP &lt;- 5\n  GHOST_THRESHOLD &lt;- 0.90\n  PMM_K &lt;- 5\n  MAXITER &lt;- 4\n\n  df &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    clean_names() %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      date = as.Date(date),\n      month = as.factor(month(date)),\n      day = as.factor(wday(date, label = TRUE)),\n      day_of_year = yday(date)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    filter(!is.na(rainfall)) %&gt;%\n    select(-rain_tomorrow)\n\n  # Missingness flags\n  df_flagged &lt;- df %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      sunshine_imp_flagged = ifelse(is.na(sunshine), 1, 0),\n      evap_imp_flagged = ifelse(is.na(evaporation), 1, 0),\n      cloud3pm_imp_flagged = ifelse(is.na(cloud3pm), 1, 0),\n      cloud9am_imp_flagged = ifelse(is.na(cloud9am), 1, 0)\n    )\n\n  # Temporal interpolation for smooth continuous variables\n  interp_vars &lt;- c(\n    \"min_temp\",\n    \"max_temp\",\n    \"temp9am\",\n    \"temp3pm\",\n    \"pressure9am\",\n    \"pressure3pm\",\n    \"humidity9am\",\n    \"humidity3pm\"\n  )\n\n  df_interp &lt;- df_flagged %&gt;%\n    group_by(location) %&gt;%\n    arrange(date, .by_group = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    mutate(across(\n      all_of(interp_vars),\n      ~ na.approx(., maxgap = MAXGAP, na.rm = FALSE, rule = 2)\n    )) %&gt;%\n    ungroup()\n\n  # Ghost sensor identification\n  ghost_prone_vars &lt;- c(\"sunshine\", \"evaporation\", \"cloud3pm\", \"cloud9am\")\n\n  ghost_pairs &lt;- df_interp %&gt;%\n    select(location, all_of(ghost_prone_vars)) %&gt;%\n    pivot_longer(\n      cols = all_of(ghost_prone_vars),\n      names_to = \"variable\",\n      values_to = \"value\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    group_by(location, variable) %&gt;%\n    summarise(\n      miss_rate = mean(is.na(value)) * 100,\n      .groups = \"drop\"\n    ) %&gt;%\n    filter(miss_rate &gt; (GHOST_THRESHOLD * 100)) %&gt;%\n    select(location, variable)\n\n  cat(sprintf(\"  Found %d ghost sensor instances\\n\\n\", nrow(ghost_pairs)))\n\n  # missRanger first pass\n  imputation_data &lt;- df_interp %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n      sin_month = sin(2 * pi * as.numeric(month) / 12),\n      cos_month = cos(2 * pi * as.numeric(month) / 12),\n      sin_doy = sin(2 * pi * day_of_year / 365),\n      cos_doy = cos(2 * pi * day_of_year / 365)\n    )\n\n  metadata_cols &lt;- imputation_data %&gt;% select(date)\n  imputation_cols &lt;- imputation_data %&gt;% select(-date)\n\n  imputed_data &lt;- missRanger(\n    data = imputation_cols,\n    pmm.k = PMM_K,\n    num.trees = 100,\n    sample.fraction = 0.3,\n    min.node.size = 10,\n    seed = 123,\n    verbose = 1,\n    maxiter = MAXITER\n  )\n\n  df_imputed &lt;- bind_cols(metadata_cols, imputed_data) %&gt;%\n    select(-starts_with(\"sin_\"), -starts_with(\"cos_\"))\n\n  # Ghost sensor sanitisation\n  if (nrow(ghost_pairs) &gt; 0) {\n    ghost_map &lt;- split(ghost_pairs$location, ghost_pairs$variable)\n    df_imputed &lt;- df_imputed %&gt;%\n      mutate(across(\n        names(ghost_map),\n        ~ replace(., location %in% ghost_map[[cur_column()]], NA)\n      ))\n    cat(sprintf(\"  Reverted %d instances to NA\\n\\n\", nrow(ghost_pairs)))\n  }\n\n  # Targeted MICE with Random Forest\n  init &lt;- mice(df_imputed, maxit = 0)\n  pred &lt;- init$predictorMatrix\n  meth &lt;- init$method\n  pred[,] &lt;- 0\n\n  meth[\"sunshine\"] &lt;- \"rf\"\n  meth[\"evaporation\"] &lt;- \"rf\"\n  meth[\"cloud9am\"] &lt;- \"rf\"\n  meth[\"cloud3pm\"] &lt;- \"rf\"\n\n  sun_predictors &lt;- intersect(\n    colnames(df_imputed),\n    c(\"cloud9am\", \"cloud3pm\", \"max_temp\", \"humidity3pm\", \"location\", \"month\")\n  )\n  evap_predictors &lt;- intersect(\n    colnames(df_imputed),\n    c(\n      \"wind_gust_speed\",\n      \"max_temp\",\n      \"humidity3pm\",\n      \"sunshine\",\n      \"location\",\n      \"month\"\n    )\n  )\n  cloud_predictors &lt;- intersect(\n    colnames(df_imputed),\n    c(\"humidity9am\", \"humidity3pm\", \"pressure9am\", \"location\", \"month\")\n  )\n\n  if (\"sunshine\" %in% rownames(pred)) {\n    pred[\"sunshine\", sun_predictors] &lt;- 1\n  }\n  if (\"evaporation\" %in% rownames(pred)) {\n    pred[\"evaporation\", evap_predictors] &lt;- 1\n  }\n  if (\"cloud9am\" %in% rownames(pred)) {\n    pred[\"cloud9am\", cloud_predictors] &lt;- 1\n  }\n  if (\"cloud3pm\" %in% rownames(pred)) {\n    pred[\"cloud3pm\", cloud_predictors] &lt;- 1\n  }\n\n  ignore_cols &lt;- grep(\"_flagged$|^date$\", colnames(pred), value = TRUE)\n  pred[, ignore_cols] &lt;- 0\n\n  imp &lt;- mice(\n    df_imputed,\n    method = meth,\n    predictorMatrix = pred,\n    m = 1,\n    maxit = 5,\n    seed = 123,\n    printFlag = FALSE\n  )\n\n  df_final &lt;- complete(imp)\n  return(df_final)\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_final &lt;- clean_and_impute_weather(df)\nwrite_csv(df_final, \"data/df_final.csv\")",

No observations are discarded on the basis of partial missingness. The imputation flags preserve the distinction between observed and imputed values, allowing downstream models to treat the two categories differently if the flag coefficients prove significant.\nTemporal coherence. The interpolated variables maintain their within-location autocorrelation structure. The five-day cap prevents the interpolation from extending across genuine data voids.\nDistributional fidelity. Predictive Mean Matching in Stage 3 ensures that imputed values for sunshine, evaporation, and cloud cover are drawn from the observed empirical distribution of each variable rather than from the regression surface. The marginal distributions and cross-variable correlations of these features are preserved, which is critical for the interaction terms and derived meteorological indices constructed in the feature engineering chapter.\nConservative treatment of extended failures. Observations from ghost sensors remain missing rather than being synthetically reconstructed. This is a deliberate acceptance of reduced sample size in exchange for data integrity: a complete but fabricated series is more damaging to downstream inference than an honest gap.",

Both require specialised instrumentation, sunshine recorders and evaporation pans, that are not uniformly deployed across all weather stations in the network. Their missingness is therefore not random with respect to geography, which means simple listwise deletion (discarding any row containing a missing value) would eliminate nearly half the dataset and introduce a systematic geographic bias toward well-resourced stations. Cloud cover observations (cloud3pm and cloud9am) are missing in approximately 37–40% of records, consistent with the same station-coverage explanation.\nBy contrast, the core dynamic variables; pressure, wind speed, and temperature exhibit missingness below 10%. These instruments are standard across virtually all monitoring stations.\nModelling implication. The concentration of missingness in potentially predictive features (sunshine and evaporation both exhibit meaningful correlation with rainfall, as shown in Section 3.4) creates a direct conflict: discarding these variables avoids imputation complexity but sacrifices predictive signal, while discarding rows sacrifices sample size and introduces bias. This finding provides the empirical justification for the Random Forest imputation strategy adopted in this study. Imputation preserves both the sample and the features, at the cost of introducing uncertainty that should be acknowledged in downstream inference.",

The most consequential property is that 64.05% of the 142,199 recorded observations are dry days (rainfall = 0 mm). The median is zero. This is not a quirk of rounding or encoding: the data-generating mechanism genuinely produces two qualitatively different outcomes, no rain falling at all, versus some positive amount of rain falling. Any model that treats the response as a single continuous variable will be forced to place probability mass on negative values and will systematically misestimate the probability of the zero outcome.\nHeavy tails. Among the non-zero observations, the distribution is severely right-skewed (skewness = 9.84). The standard deviation (8.48 mm) is nearly four times the mean (2.36 mm), indicating that the “average” is being pulled by a small number of extreme events. Kurtosis of 181.15 compared to 3 for a normal distribution confirms that such extremes occur far more frequently than a Gaussian model would predict. The maximum recorded value is 371 mm, and 151 events exceed 100 mm.\nModelling implication. The conjunction of zero-inflation and extreme positive skew means that a single-component model is insufficient. The data implicitly poses two separate questions: Does rain occur? (a binary classification problem) and Given that it does, how much falls? (a positive continuous regression problem). This motivates the Hurdle Model or Zero-Inflated Gamma framework adopted in subsequent analysis, which explicitly separates these two sub-problems rather than conflating them.",

Humidity3pm (\\(r = 0.44\\)) and cloud cover (\\(r \\approx 0.37\\)) show the strongest positive associations with rainfall. High afternoon humidity indicates that moisture has accumulated in the lower atmosphere over the course of the day, creating conditions favourable for precipitation. Cloud cover is both a physical precondition for rain and a consequence of the same atmospheric dynamics that generate it.\nRadiation and evaporation indicators (negative association). Sunshine (\\(r = -0.40\\)) and evaporation (\\(r = -0.31\\)) exhibit the strongest negative associations. Long sunshine hours are a proxy for clear-sky, high-pressure conditions in which precipitation is unlikely. High evaporation similarly signals warm, dry, low-humidity surface conditions.\nMulticollinearity. The correlation heatmap (Figure 3.1) also reveals substantial redundancy among predictors. The morning and afternoon readings of the same variable are typically highly correlated pressure9am and pressure3pm share a Spearman correlation of \\(r = 0.96\\), and the two temperature readings are similarly collinear. Including both members of such pairs in a regression model inflates standard errors and destabilises coefficient estimates, a problem known as multicollinearity. This observation directly motivates VIF-based feature selection in the modelling stage.\nStatistical validation. A formal comparison of the two strongest opposing predictors (humidity and sunshine) using Steiger’s Z-test for dependent correlations yields \\(z \\approx 188.9\\), \\(p &lt; 2.2 \\times 10^{-16}\\). With \\(N &gt; 140,000\\) observations, virtually any non-trivial effect will achieve statistical significance, so the p-value alone is uninformative here. The magnitude of the Z-statistic, however, confirms that the differential predictive strength of these two variables is not a sampling artefact. Humidity and sunshine represent genuinely distinct physical forces operating in opposing directions on the probability of precipitation.",

Their effects on rainfall frequency are qualitatively different.\nWeekly cycle. The distribution of wet days across the days of the week is approximately uniform, ranging from 13.8% on weekends to 14.7% on Tuesdays. This near-uniformity is physically expected: the atmospheric processes that produce precipitation operate independently of the human social calendar. The slight variation observed is consistent with random sampling noise rather than a systematic signal. This suggests that Day carries little predictive information and, at best, warrants treatment as a minor control variable rather than a substantive predictor.\nAnnual cycle. The monthly distribution tells a markedly different story. June (10.7%) and July (10.3%) record the highest frequency of wet days, consistent with the Southern Hemisphere winter, when frontal weather systems from the Southern Ocean bring prolonged rainfall to southern Australia. The summer months February (6.5%) and December (7.0%) record the lowest frequencies. The cross-tabulation of month by day confirms that this seasonal signal is not an artefact of any particular day of the week: June and July show consistently elevated counts across all seven days (roughly 750–800 events per day), while February counts drop uniformly to approximately 450–480 per day. Month is thus a legitimate predictor warranting explicit inclusion in the model specification.\n\n\n3.5.2 Day-to-Day Persistence: A Markov Chain Analysis\n\n\nCode\nmarkov_table &lt;- df_final %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(yesterday_rain = lag(rain_today)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(rain_today), !is.na(yesterday_rain)) %&gt;%\n  count(yesterday_rain, rain_today)\n\ncont_table &lt;- markov_table %&gt;%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = rain_today, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %&gt;%\n  column_to_rownames(\"yesterday_rain\") %&gt;%\n  as.matrix()\n\nprint(cont_table)\n\n\n       No   Yes\nNo  93231 17043\nYes 17047 14829\n\n\n\n\nCode\nchi_result &lt;- chisq_test(as.table(cont_table))\nprint(chi_result)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 6\n##        n statistic     p    df method          p.signif\n## *  &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;   \n## 1 142150    13718.     0     1 Chi-square test ****\n\ncramers_v &lt;- cramer_v(cont_table)\n\ncat(\"\\nEffect Size Interpretation\\n\")\n## \n## Effect Size Interpretation\ncat(sprintf(\"V = %.4f: \", cramers_v))\n## V = 0.3107:\nif (cramers_v &lt; 0.1) {\n  cat(\"Negligible Association\\n\")\n} else if (cramers_v &lt; 0.3) {\n  cat(\"Weak Association\\n\")\n} else if (cramers_v &lt; 0.5) {\n  cat(\"Moderate Association\\n\")\n} else {\n  cat(\"Strong Association\\n\")\n}\n## Moderate Association\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmarkov_data &lt;- df_final %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(yesterday_rain = lag(rain_today)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(rain_today), !is.na(yesterday_rain))\n\nmarkov_data %&gt;%\n  count(yesterday_rain, rain_today) %&gt;%\n  group_by(yesterday_rain) %&gt;%\n  mutate(prob = n / sum(n)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = yesterday_rain, y = rain_today, fill = prob)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = scales::percent(prob, accuracy = 1)),\n    color = \"white\",\n    size = 8,\n    fontface = \"bold\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"viridis\", begin = 0.2, end = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Markov Chain: Rain Persistence Effect\",\n    subtitle = sprintf(\n      \"X^2 = %.2f, p &lt; 0.001, Cramer's V = %.3f (Moderate Association)\\nYesterday's rain strongly predicts today's rain state.\",\n      chi_result$statistic,\n      cramers_v\n    ),\n    x = \"Did it Rain Yesterday?\",\n    y = \"Did it Rain Today?\",\n    fill = \"Probability\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Markov Chain Transition Matrix: Visualizing the ‘Persistence Effect’ in Australian Rainfall.\n\n\n\n\n\nA natural question when analysing time-series weather data is whether consecutive days exhibit statistical dependence, in other words, does knowing whether it rained yesterday improve our prediction of whether it will rain today? We model this as a first-order Markov Chain, where the state space is binary (rain / no rain) and the transition probabilities are estimated directly from the data.\nThe Pearson Chi-squared test of independence yields \\(\\chi^2 \\approx 13,718\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rejecting the null hypothesis of daily independence by a large margin. Cramer’s V (\\(V \\approx 0.31\\)) translates this to a moderate practical effect size, confirming that the relationship is not merely a consequence of the large sample.\nThe estimated transition matrix (Figure 3.2) reveals an important asymmetry between the two weather states. When the previous day was dry, there is an 85% probability of remaining dry the high-pressure systems that suppress rainfall are persistent and self-reinforcing. When the previous day was wet, however, there is only a 47% probability of continued rain, meaning rain events are more transient and less self-sustaining than dry spells. This asymmetry has a clear atmospheric interpretation: large anticyclonic systems that block rainfall can persist for days to weeks, while frontal systems that bring rain typically pass through more quickly.\nThe practical implication for modelling is that rain_today (lagged one day) carries meaningful predictive signal and should be considered as a candidate feature. However, its modest effect size also demonstrates that autocorrelation alone is insufficient as a predictor: the wet state is too transient for a persistence-only rule to be reliable, and other meteorological covariates are necessary to capture the onset and cessation of rainfall events.\n\n\n3.5.3 Dry Spell Dynamics and Temporal Decay\n\n\nCode\ndry_spell_data &lt;- df_final %&gt;%\n  group_by(location) %&gt;%\n  arrange(date) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    did_rain_yesterday = lag(rainfall &gt; 0, default = FALSE),\n    dry_spell_id = cumsum(did_rain_yesterday)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(location, dry_spell_id) %&gt;%\n  mutate(days_since_rain = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  filter(days_since_rain &lt;= 30) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rain_binary = as.numeric(rainfall &gt; 0))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlogit_model &lt;- glm(\n  rain_binary ~ days_since_rain,\n  data = dry_spell_data,\n  family = binomial(link = \"logit\")\n)\n\nwald_test &lt;- aod::wald.test(\n  b = coef(logit_model),\n  Sigma = vcov(logit_model),\n  Terms = 2\n)\n\nor_results &lt;- tidy(logit_model, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  filter(term == \"days_since_rain\")\n\nprint(wald_test)\n## Wald test:\n## ----------\n## \n## Chi-squared test:\n## X2 = 8099.7, df = 1, P(&gt; X2) = 0.0\ncat(sprintf(\n  \"\\nFor each additional day without rain, odds of rainfall decrease by %.1f%%\\n\",\n  (1 - or_results$estimate) * 100\n))\n## \n## For each additional day without rain, odds of rainfall decrease by 16.5%\ncat(sprintf(\n  \"95%% CI: [%.3f, %.3f]\\n\",\n  or_results$conf.low,\n  or_results$conf.high\n))\n## 95% CI: [0.831, 0.838]\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlogit_spline &lt;- glm(\n  rain_binary ~ splines::ns(days_since_rain, df = 4),\n  data = dry_spell_data,\n  family = binomial\n)\n\nlrt_result &lt;- anova(logit_model, logit_spline, test = \"LRT\")\nprint(lrt_result)\n## Analysis of Deviance Table\n## \n## Model 1: rain_binary ~ days_since_rain\n## Model 2: rain_binary ~ splines::ns(days_since_rain, df = 4)\n##   Resid.

The probability of rain decays exponentially as the dry spell lengthens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the day-to-day Markov persistence documented above, we investigate a longer-horizon question: does the cumulative length of an ongoing dry spell influence the probability of rain on any given day? This is framed as a survival-style problem in which the “event” is the return of rainfall after a period of absence.\nA logistic regression of daily rain occurrence on days_since_rain yields a significant negative coefficient (Wald \\(\\chi^2 \\approx 8099\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)), with an odds ratio of \\(OR = 0.835\\). Concretely, each additional dry day reduces the odds of rainfall by approximately 16.5%. This is consistent with the feedback mechanism described in the Markov analysis: prolonged dry conditions are associated with the establishment of stable high-pressure ridges that become progressively more resistant to disruption by incoming frontal systems.\nThe linear logistic model is, however, an approximation. A Likelihood Ratio Test comparing it against a four-degree-of-freedom natural spline model is highly significant (LRT \\(\\chi^2 \\approx 7678\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)), indicating meaningful non-linearity in the decay trajectory. Examining the empirical probabilities in Figure 3.3, the pattern is clear: rain probability falls sharply from approximately 48% on Day 1 to around 18% by Day 10, after which the decline slows considerably, plateauing in the 12–16% range through Days 15 to 30. The linear model underestimates the steepness of the initial decline and overestimates the rate of decline in long droughts.\nThis “rapid-then-gradual” decay pattern suggests that models incorporating dry spell duration as a predictor would benefit from a spline parameterisation of days_since_rain rather than a simple linear term.",

We analyse both the absolute pressure level and its diurnal change (morning to afternoon) as potential features.\nNormality. The Q-Q plots show modest tail deviations from normality in the pressure variables, but with \\(N &gt; 140,000\\) observations the Central Limit Theorem ensures that sample means are approximately normally distributed regardless. Welch’s t-test which does not assume equal variances is therefore valid here, and multiple comparison correction is applied via the Bonferroni-Holm procedure.\nBaseline pressure. Rainy days are characterised by measurably lower mean pressure: 1015 hPa at 9:00 AM compared to 1018.5 hPa on dry days (Figure 3.5). Welch’s t-test confirms the difference is highly significant (\\(p &lt; 0.001\\)), with Cohen’s \\(d \\approx 0.28\\)–\\(0.48\\) a small-to-medium effect that is consistent with the expectation that absolute pressure is necessary but not sufficient for rain.\nDiurnal pressure change. The more distinctive signal lies in the change in pressure across the day. On dry days, pressure drops by a mean of 2.7 hPa from morning to afternoon the standard thermal low driven by daytime solar heating of the surface. On rainy days, this drop is suppressed to just 1.3 hPa, because cloud cover reduces insolation and limits surface warming. This suppression of the normal diurnal cycle is a subtler but remarkably informative signal: Cohen’s \\(d = -0.72\\) for pressure_change represents a medium effect size, stronger than either of the absolute pressure readings individually.\nThis finding suggests that the rate of pressure change during the day not just its absolute level may be a more discriminating feature for modelling rainfall occurrence.",

This section investigates a separate question: when rain does occur, does the season affect how much falls?\nThe ridgeline plots (Figure 3.6) reveal a clear and cyclical pattern in rainfall intensity. January and February distributions are shifted systematically to the right of the global median, indicating that summer storms though they occur less frequently than winter fronts are considerably more intense when they do arrive. The distributions for June through August cluster to the left, representing lower but more consistent rainfall. The transition months (March–May and September–November) occupy an intermediate position that smoothly connects these two poles.\nThe seasonal breakdown (Figure 3.7) reveals an additional distinction in distributional shape. Summer rainfall has a wide interquartile range and a pronounced right tail extending beyond 100 mm per day, reflecting the episodic and convective nature of summer storms. Winter rainfall has a narrower, more peaked distribution: events are more predictable in magnitude but lighter on average. February records the highest mean intensity per wet day at 10.1 mm, nearly double July’s 4.9 mm (Figure 3.8).\nCritically, this seasonal variation in intensity is separate from the seasonal variation in frequency. Both dimensions carry independent information: a model must account not only for the higher probability of rain in winter but also for the greater potential severity of rain in summer.\nEncoding implication. Because the seasonal cycle is continuous the transition from December to January is climatologically smooth treating Month as an unordered categorical variable discards information about the ordering and proximity of months. The preferred approach is cyclical encoding via sine and cosine transformations of the month number, which preserves the circular geometry of the annual cycle and allows the model to represent the smooth intensification from winter trough to summer peak.\n\n\n3.7.2 Statistical Validation\n\n\nCode\nseasonal_stats &lt;- seasonal_data %&gt;%\n  select(season, rainfall) %&gt;%\n  group_by(season) %&gt;%\n  get_summary_stats(rainfall, type = \"mean_sd\")\n\nseasonal_stats %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Descriptive Statistics of Rainfall Intensity by Season\",\n    col.names = c(\"Season\", \"Variable\", \"N (Events)\", \"Mean (mm)\", \"SD (mm)\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Rainfall Intensity by Season\n\n\nSeason\nVariable\nN (Events)\nMean (mm)\nSD (mm)\n\n\n\n\nSummer\nrainfall\n10571\n9.070\n18.195\n\n\nAutumn\nrainfall\n13382\n6.667\n13.495\n\n\nWinter\nrainfall\n15402\n5.463\n9.809\n\n\nSpring\nrainfall\n11764\n5.651\n10.495\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nkw_result &lt;- kruskal_test(rainfall ~ season, data = seasonal_data)\nepsilon_sq &lt;- kruskal_effsize(rainfall ~ season, data = seasonal_data)\n\ntibble(\n  Test = \"Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test\",\n  `Chi-squared` = kw_result$statistic,\n  df = kw_result$df,\n  `P-value` = kw_result$p,\n  `Effect Size` = epsilon_sq$effsize,\n  Magnitude = as.character(epsilon_sq$magnitude)\n) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    `Chi-squared` = round(`Chi-squared`, 2),\n    `Effect Size` = round(`Effect Size`, 4),\n    `P-value` = scales::pvalue(`P-value`, accuracy = 0.001)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Statistical Significance of Seasonal Differences (Non-Parametric)\",\n    align = \"lccccr\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(\n    bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"),\n    full_width = FALSE,\n    position = \"left\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  add_footnote(\n    c(\n      \"Effect size measured by Epsilon-squared.\",\n      \"Significance level: alpha = 0.05\"\n    ),\n    notation = \"symbol\"\n  )\n\n\n\nStatistical Significance of Seasonal Differences (Non-Parametric)\n\n\nTest\nChi-squared\ndf\nP-value\nEffect Size\nMagnitude\n\n\n\n\nKruskal-Wallis Rank Sum Test\n230.44\n3\n&lt;0.001\n0.0044\nsmall\n\n\n\n* Effect size measured by Epsilon-squared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n† Significance level: alpha = 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndunn_result &lt;- dunn_test(\n  rainfall ~ season,\n  data = seasonal_data,\n  p.adjust.method = \"bonferroni\"\n)\n\ndunn_result %&gt;%\n  select(group1, group2, statistic, p.adj, p.adj.signif) %&gt;%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Dunn's Pairwise Comparison Test (Bonferroni Corrected)\",\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Group 1\",\n      \"Group 2\",\n      \"Z-Statistic\",\n      \"Adj.

The null hypothesis is that the four seasons are drawn from the same underlying distribution of rainfall intensity.\nThe test yields \\(\\chi^2 = 230\\), \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), strongly rejecting the null. The epsilon-squared effect size (\\(\\eta^2 \\approx 0.004\\)), however, is classified as small. This warrants careful interpretation: the seasonal signal is real and not a sampling artefact, but season alone accounts for only a minor fraction of the total variance in rainfall intensity. Location, pressure regime, and other meteorological covariates contribute substantially to the remaining variance, an observation that reinforces the necessity of a multivariate modelling approach.\nPost-hoc pairwise comparisons via Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction identify three distinct statistical groups (Figure 3.9). Summer stands alone as the most intense season (\\(\\bar{x} = 9.1\\) mm, significantly different from all others, \\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). Autumn and Spring are statistically indistinguishable from each other (\\(p = 1.0\\)), forming a middle group of transitional intensity. Winter registers the lowest mean intensity (\\(\\bar{x} = 5.5\\) mm) and, while visually similar to Spring, is statistically distinct from it (\\(p_{\\text{adj}} = 0.026\\)).",

Rain events concentrate tightly in the upper-left ‘Rain Corner’, justifying a multiplicative interaction term.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation analysis in Section 3.4 established that humidity and sunshine are individually among the strongest predictors of rainfall. A standard additive model would treat their effects as independent meaning the influence of humidity on rainfall probability does not depend on how much sunshine has occurred, and vice versa. This section tests whether that independence assumption is justified.\nTo do so, we examine the joint distribution of Humidity3pm and Sunshine, separately for days on which rain did and did not occur. If the two variables act independently, the joint distributions for the two weather states should be geometrically similar shifted, perhaps, but with the same basic shape. If they interact, the shapes will differ fundamentally.\nThe bivariate density plots (Figure 3.10) reveal a striking structural difference. On dry days, the density is dispersed broadly across the humidity-sunshine space: it is possible to observe high humidity without rain (if other conditions, such as elevated pressure, suppress precipitation) and it is possible to have low sunshine without rain. There is no single region of feature space that cleanly separates dry from wet conditions based on these two variables alone.\nOn rainy days, the picture is qualitatively different. The density collapses into a tight, concentrated cluster in the upper-left quadrant: high afternoon humidity (above approximately 50%) combined with low sunshine (below approximately 5 hours). This region which we call the “Rain Corner” captures the simultaneous presence of atmospheric moisture and the absence of solar conditions that would otherwise inhibit precipitation.\nThe physical interpretation is intuitive: neither high humidity alone nor low sunshine alone is sufficient to produce rain. Both conditions must coincide. This is the definition of statistical interaction: the effect of one variable on the outcome is conditional on the level of another.\nModelling implication. An additive model that includes Humidity3pm and Sunshine as separate terms will fail to recover this corner structure because it cannot represent the idea that their joint occurrence, rather than their individual magnitudes, is what matters. Capturing this behaviour requires a multiplicative interaction term (\\(\\text{Humidity} \\times \\text{Sunshine}\\)) in the model specification, allowing the model to assign elevated probability to the “Rain Corner” region while leaving other areas of feature space relatively unaffected.",

    "text": "3.9 Summary and Modelling Implications\nThe preceding analyses characterise the Australian rainfall dataset along several interconnected dimensions. Taken together, they point toward a specific set of modelling requirements.\nThe distributional structure of the target variable 64% zeros, extreme positive skew, and kurtosis of 181 rules out any single-component Gaussian model. A two-part framework (Hurdle or Zero-Inflated Gamma) that separately models the occurrence and the intensity of rainfall is the appropriate response to this structure.\nThe missingness analysis establishes that imputation, rather than deletion, is necessary to preserve both sample size and the predictive signal contained in sunshine and evaporation. Random Forest imputation is well-suited to this task because it can exploit correlations among the observed variables to generate principled estimates for missing ones.\nThe correlation structure identifies humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, and evaporation as the strongest individual predictors, while also flagging severe multicollinearity among the morning-afternoon pairs of pressure and temperature readings. VIF-based feature selection is required to address this.\nThe temporal analyses establish that both the day-to-day Markov state and the cumulative dry spell duration carry meaningful predictive signal, though neither is sufficient on its own. Month should be cyclically encoded to preserve the circular geometry of the seasonal cycle.\nThe pressure analysis identifies the diurnal pressure change not merely the absolute pressure level as the most discriminating pressure-derived feature, with a medium Cohen’s \\(d\\) of 0.72 separating rainy from dry days.\nFinally, the interaction analysis provides empirical justification for including a \\(\\text{Humidity} \\times \\text{Sunshine}\\) interaction term, reflecting the physical reality that precipitation is most likely when high moisture and low solar radiation coincide simultaneously.",

    "text": "4.2 Signal Extraction via Moving Averages\nDaily meteorological observations are inherently noisy. A single day’s rainfall measurement reflects both the underlying weather regime and a high-frequency stochastic component, the difference between a storm cell passing directly over a station versus five kilometres to its east. Before engineering predictive features from this signal, we must first assess whether smoothing can reduce this noise and, if so, at what cost.\nWe compute rolling means over 3-day and 7-day trailing windows for both rainfall and afternoon humidity. Right-alignment is enforced throughout, meaning the average at time \\(t\\) is computed from observations at \\(t\\), \\(t-1\\), …, \\(t-(k-1)\\).

Peaks sharpen and tails compress as the averaging window increases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe density plots in Figure 4.1 make the smoothing effect immediately apparent. The raw daily distribution (pink) is severely right-skewed with a long tail reaching into the hundreds of millimetres, a consequence of the extreme kurtosis documented in the Chapter 3. The 3-day moving average (orange) begins to suppress this variance, and the 7-day average (green) produces a substantially more concentrated distribution whose peak is considerably higher and whose tails are dramatically shorter.\nQuantitatively (Figure 4.2), the standard deviation of rainfall intensity falls from 13.1 mm in the raw series to 5.8 mm under the 7-day average, a reduction of 56%. The ridgeline plot (Figure 4.3) confirms that this compression is not an artefact of the summary statistic: the entire shape of the distribution tightens, with each additional day of averaging producing a distribution that is more peaked and less diffuse. The 7-day average can therefore be interpreted as a measure of the “weekly wetness regime”.A smoothed characterisation of whether the preceding week has been generally wet or generally dry rather than the unpredictability of any single day’s precipitation.\n\n\n4.2.2 Multicollinearity Trade-off\n\n\nCode\ncor_data &lt;- ma_data %&gt;%\n  select(\n    rainfall,\n    rainfall_ma3,\n    rainfall_ma7,\n    humidity3pm,\n    humidity_ma3,\n    humidity_ma7\n  ) %&gt;%\n  cor(use = \"complete.obs\", method = \"spearman\") %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column(\"var1\") %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-var1, names_to = \"var2\", values_to = \"correlation\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    var1 = factor(\n      var1,\n      levels = c(\n        \"rainfall\",\n        \"rainfall_ma3\",\n        \"rainfall_ma7\",\n        \"humidity3pm\",\n        \"humidity_ma3\",\n        \"humidity_ma7\"\n      )\n    ),\n    var2 = factor(\n      var2,\n      levels = c(\n        \"rainfall\",\n        \"rainfall_ma3\",\n        \"rainfall_ma7\",\n        \"humidity3pm\",\n        \"humidity_ma3\",\n        \"humidity_ma7\"\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(cor_data, aes(var2, var1, fill = correlation)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = sprintf(\"%.2f\", correlation)),\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    size = 3.5\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(\n    low = \"#0072B2\",\n    mid = \"white\",\n    high = \"#D55E00\",\n    midpoint = 0,\n    limits = c(-1, 1),\n    name = \"Correlation\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Feature Correlations: Raw vs Moving Averages\",\n    subtitle = \"MAs are highly correlated with each other (potential multicollinearity)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey40\", margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Feature Correlations: Raw vs Moving Averages. High correlations between MA features warn of multicollinearity risks for linear model families.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe noise-reduction benefit of moving averages comes at a cost. As shown in Figure 4.4, the 3-day and 7-day humidity moving averages share a Spearman correlation of 0.89, and the equivalent rainfall moving averages are similarly collinear with each other and with the raw series. Including multiple moving average windows alongside their source variables in the same linear model would produce a near-singular design matrix, inflating coefficient standard errors and making the model numerically unstable.\nThis presents a choice between responsiveness and stability. The 3-day average reacts more quickly to changing conditions but retains more of the day-to-day variability. The 7-day average is more stable but slower to reflect recent changes in the weather regime. For linear model families such as logistic regression, only one window can be safely retained per variable; including both is not viable. For tree-based models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, this constraint does not apply, since these methods select among correlated features at each split rather than inverting the full covariance matrix. The moving average selection strategy therefore depends on the model family, a consideration that informs the variable selection carried out in the subsequent modelling chapter.",

Treating month as a standard integer (1 through 12) would incorrectly imply that January and December are maximally distant on the number line, when in reality they are climatologically adjacent. Treating it as an unordered factor imposes no such adjacency constraint but discards ordinal information entirely.\nThe appropriate solution is to represent the annual cycle as a point on the unit circle, decomposed into its sine and cosine components:\n\\[\\text{day\\_sin} = \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{day\\_of\\_year}}{365}\\right), \\quad \\text{day\\_cos} = \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{day\\_of\\_year}}{365}\\right)\\]\nTogether, these two features encode any day of the year as a unique coordinate on the unit circle. The distance between any two days in this space reflects their true circular proximity: the December-to-January transition corresponds to a small arc, not a large jump. The model can learn smooth seasonal effects directly from the geometry of this representation.\n\n\n4.3.2 Temporal Persistence Features\nThe Markov Chain analysis (Section 3.5.2) demonstrated that the previous day’s rain state carries a moderate but meaningful signal (\\(V \\approx 0.31\\)), and the dry spell analysis showed that the probability of rain decays in a non-linear pattern as dry spells lengthen. Three features capture these dynamics.\nrain_yesterday is a direct binary indicator of the previous day’s state, encoding the first-order Markov transition directly as a predictor. days_since_rain counts the number of consecutive dry days preceding the current observation, capturing the progressive stabilisation of dry conditions that the logistic regression and spline analysis identified. rainfall_ma7 and humidity_ma7 provide a smoothed weekly context for both the rainfall and moisture signals, lagged by one additional day beyond the rolling window to ensure that no same-day information is included when predicting today’s outcome.\nThe lagging step deserves emphasis. Without it, the 7-day moving average at time \\(t\\) includes the observation at time \\(t\\) itself, meaning a model trained on this feature would have access to the value it is trying to predict. This form of data leakage produces artificially optimistic training metrics that do not generalise to deployment, where future observations are unavailable by definition.\n\n\n4.3.3 Physical Interaction and Derived Indices\nThe bivariate density analysis (Section 3.8) identified a qualitative difference in the joint distribution of humidity and sunshine between rainy and dry days: rain occurs almost exclusively when afternoon humidity is high and sunshine hours are low simultaneously, the “Rain Corner” phenomenon. An additive model cannot represent this conditional structure; a multiplicative interaction term is required.\nPrior to computing the interaction, both sunshine and humidity3pm are mean-centred (their grand means are subtracted). This is not merely a cosmetic step. When an interaction term is formed from un-centred variables, the resulting product is algebraically correlated with both main effects, inflating the VIF of all three terms and making their individual coefficients difficult to interpret. Centring removes this artificial correlation: the main effects then represent the effect of each variable at the average level of the other, and the interaction term represents the additional effect of their joint deviation. This is confirmed empirically in the VIF diagnostics in Section 3.\nBeyond the interaction term, five derived meteorological indices are constructed from physically motivated combinations of the available variables. The dewpoint temperatures at 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM computed from the Magnus approximation \\(T_d \\approx T - \\frac{100 - RH}{5}\\) represent the temperature at which the air would become saturated if cooled at constant pressure. The change in dewpoint across the day (dewpoint_change) measures whether the atmosphere is gaining or losing moisture over the course of the day, a signal not directly recoverable from temperature or humidity alone. The moisture_index encodes the combined effect of high humidity and limited solar exposure. The instability_index combines pressure deficit from the standard 1020 hPa baseline with humidity, approximating the atmospheric conditions that favour convective development. cloud_development captures upward cloud formation during the day, which the pressure analysis identified as a meaningful precursor to precipitation.\n\n\n4.3.4 Circular Wind Vector Decomposition\nWind direction is a circular variable: 360 \\(^\\circ\\) and 0 \\(^\\circ\\) represent the same direction (due North), yet a naive numeric encoding would treat them as maximally distant. This misrepresentation is particularly consequential for wind because the directional origin of an air mass carries meaningful physical content, moisture-laden northerly flows behave very differently from dry southerly flows in the Australian context.\nThe standard solution is to decompose each directional reading into orthogonal Cartesian components by projecting the wind vector onto the north-south and east-west axes:\n\\[U_{EW} = v \\cdot \\sin(\\theta), \\quad V_{NS} = v \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is wind speed (in km/h) and \\(\\theta\\) is the compass bearing in radians. The resulting U and V components are continuous and interpretable: a purely northerly wind of 20 km/h produces \\(V_{NS} = 20\\), \\(U_{EW} = 0\\); a purely easterly wind of the same speed produces \\(V_{NS} = 0\\), \\(U_{EW} = 20\\). This transformation is applied to both the peak gust and the 9:00 AM wind observations, yielding four wind component features in total.",

After constructing the full feature set, it is therefore essential to verify that no predictor has become so collinear with the others that its coefficient in a linear model would be effectively unidentifiable. We use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for this diagnosis. The VIF for a given predictor quantifies how much its coefficient variance is inflated relative to what it would be in an orthogonal design: a VIF of \\(k\\) indicates that the standard error of that coefficient is \\(\\sqrt{k}\\) times larger than it would be if the predictor were uncorrelated with all others. Values above 10 are conventionally treated as indicating severe collinearity requiring remediation.\nCyclical and wind components. The day_sin, day_cos, gust_V_NS, and gust_U_EW features all show VIF values well below 3. This confirms that the decomposition strategies, sine/cosine for the annual cycle and U/V projection for wind direction, successfully converted circular variables into continuous representations without introducing redundancy. Each component carries information that is approximately orthogonal to its pair.\nInteraction stability. The sun_humid_interaction term has a VIF of 1.188, which is exceptionally low for a multiplicative interaction. Without mean-centring the constituent variables before multiplication, interaction terms routinely exhibit VIFs above 10 due to their algebraic overlap with the main effects. The observed value of 1.188 provides empirical confirmation that centring eliminated this artificial correlation, and that the interaction term is capturing a genuinely distinct dimension of the feature space, the joint “Rain Corner” structure identified in the EDA.\nElevated collinearity in humidity. The highest observed VIF is for humidity3pm at approximately 4.832. This is expected: humidity participates structurally in three of the derived features (moisture_index, instability_index, and sun_humid_interaction), and its 7-day moving average is also present in the feature set. A VIF of 5 lies below the conventional threshold of 10 for severe concern and is consistent with what the literature describes as moderate collinearity. The decision to retain humidity3pm despite this inflation is deliberate: it is the single strongest individual predictor of rainfall in the dataset (Spearman \\(r = 0.44\\), as established in the Chapter 3), and removing it in favour of its derived aggregates would sacrifice the direct same-day atmospheric moisture signal for the sake of a marginal improvement in collinearity. For tree-based models, this trade-off does not arise, since these methods are not sensitive to multicollinearity by design.\nOverall assessment. The full engineered feature set is numerically stable for use in linear model families. No VIF exceeds the critical threshold of 10, and the majority of features show values below 3. The pipeline has successfully converted the raw meteorological signals into a representation that is both physically interpretable and statistically well-conditioned for the modelling stage.",

    "text": "5.2 Model Architecture\nA Zero-Inflated Gamma model is a two-component mixture. The first component, the zero-inflation submodel, is a logistic regression that estimates the probability of a structurally zero outcome, a dry day on which no precipitation occurs regardless of atmospheric conditions. The second component, the conditional intensity submodel, is a Gamma regression (with log link) that models the expected rainfall given that rain does fall. Together they answer the two questions identified in the Chapter 3: “Will it rain?” and “If so, how much?”\nFormally, for observation \\(i\\):\n\\[P(Y_i = 0) = \\pi_i + (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(0)\\] \\[P(Y_i = y) = (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(y \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi), \\quad y &gt; 0\\]\nwhere \\(\\pi_i = \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\) is the zero-inflation probability and \\(\\mu_i = \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\) is the conditional mean intensity. The two linear predictors, \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\), can include different sets of covariates, allowing predictors of occurrence to differ from predictors of intensity. All models were fitted using glmmTMB, which implements maximum likelihood estimation for this family via the Template Model Builder.\nProgressive model construction serves two purposes.

It also enables incremental comparison: each model can be evaluated against its predecessor to isolate the contribution of the newly added component.",

Model 1 formalises these findings by introducing the four most physically direct atmospheric drivers into the conditional intensity submodel, and a subset of moisture indicators into the zero-inflation submodel.\nThe AIC falls from 461,669.7 to 422,630, a reduction of approximately 39069.7 points, the largest single improvement in the entire model sequence. This magnitude confirms that atmospheric moisture and pressure dynamics are not merely correlated with rainfall but are its fundamental predictive substrate.\nAll four predictors in the conditional model are highly significant (\\(p &lt; 2 \\times 10^{-16}\\)). The positive coefficients for humidity3pm (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.38\\)) and dewpoint_9am (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.38\\)) indicate that both relative saturation of the afternoon air and the absolute moisture content of the morning atmosphere independently increase rainfall intensity when rain does occur.\nThe zero-inflation submodel reveals a meaningful asymmetry between the two moisture variables. humidity3pm carries a coefficient of \\(-1.07\\): the negative sign reflects the logistic parameterisation, where larger values reduce the probability of a dry outcome, so higher humidity strongly increases the probability of rain. dewpoint_9am, by contrast, is not significant in the zero-inflation component (\\(p = 0.907\\)). This dissociation suggests that it is the relative saturation of the afternoon atmosphere that determines whether the threshold for precipitation is crossed, while the absolute morning moisture content shapes the intensity of rainfall once it occurs.",

The Markov Chain analysis (Section 3.5.2) demonstrated that yesterday’s rain state carries a moderate but practically significant effect (\\(V \\approx 0.31\\)), and the seasonal analysis confirmed that both frequency and intensity of rainfall follow a smooth annual cycle. Cyclical sine/cosine encoding enters the conditional model, while rain_yesterday, cloud_development, and pressure_change are added to the zero-inflation component.\nAIC falls to 406,826 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 15,804\\) relative to Model 1), confirming that temporal context when in the year and what happened the day before contributes substantial predictive information beyond the instantaneous atmospheric state.\nBoth seasonal components are highly significant, providing statistical confirmation of the cyclical pattern documented in the EDA(Chapter 3). The continuous circular encoding correctly captures the smooth transition between the winter trough and the summer peak rather than imposing an arbitrary step at the calendar year boundary.\nThe most striking result is the persistence coefficient. At \\(\\hat{\\beta}_{zi} = -1.42\\) in the zero-inflation component, it is the strongest predictor in the hurdle submodel across the entire model sequence. Exponentiating gives \\(e^{-1.42} \\approx 0.24\\): having rained yesterday reduces the odds of today being dry by approximately 76%. This quantifies the asymmetric persistence documented in the Markov transition matrix wet states are more likely to continue than to terminate.",

The dry spell analysis (Section 3.5.3) demonstrated that rainfall probability decays as dry spells lengthen, and the moving average analysis showed that a 7-day smoothed signal substantially reduces the stochastic variance of the rainfall and humidity series. Model 3 introduces these medium-horizon history features into the conditional intensity submodel.\nThe improvement is AIC = 405,125 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 1,701\\) versus Model 2). This is smaller than the earlier gains, reflecting the natural diminishing returns of adding temporally redundant information once the most immediate history has been captured. The signal is nonetheless genuine.\nThe results reveal an interpretable separation between the roles of immediate and accumulated history. rain_yesterday in the conditional model (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.31\\), \\(e^{0.31} \\approx 1.36\\)) indicates that if it rained the previous day, today’s rainfall is approximately 36% more intense on average consistent with a persisting frontal system delivering successive events of comparable severity. rainfall_ma7 (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = 0.13\\)) extends this logic to the weekly horizon: a wetter preceding week is associated with heavier current rainfall, suggesting that prolonged wet spells are symptomatic of deeper atmospheric systems rather than sequences of independent events.\nThe negative coefficient for humidity_ma7 (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.10\\)) warrants careful interpretation. Conditional on all other terms, a persistently humid preceding week is associated with slightly lower rainfall intensity. This likely reflects a distinction between two meteorological regimes: stratiform cloud systems, which sustain high background humidity without producing intense precipitation, versus convective systems, which generate intense episodic rainfall under conditions of rapid moisture change rather than steady elevated humidity.\nFinally, days_since_rain is not significant in the conditional intensity component (\\(p = 0.14\\)). The dry spell length predicts whether rain occurs, but once the model knows rain is occurring, the duration of the preceding drought provides no additional information about how much will fall. This reinforces the conceptual separation between the occurrence and intensity sub-processes.",

An additive model cannot represent this conditional structure. Model 4 introduces the multiplicative interaction term alongside the broader thermodynamic context from which it arises.\nAIC falls to 403,742 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 1,383\\) versus Model 3).\nThe sun_humid_interaction coefficient of \\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.07\\) is highly significant and physically interpretable. The negative sign indicates that the combination of high humidity and low sunshine which, after mean-centring, produces a large negative product, is associated with heavier rainfall. This formalises the “Rain Corner” structure: neither variable alone is sufficient, but their adverse conjunction under saturated, overcast conditions is where the most intense events concentrate.\nThe entry of the interaction term also produces a marked reduction in the humidity3pm coefficient, from 0.39 in Model 3 to 0.16 in Model 4. This is not a loss of importance. It reflects a correct partitioning of explained variance: the portion of humidity’s effect that operates through its interaction with sunshine, and through the derived instability_index, is now carried by those terms. The model has moved from knowing that humidity matters to capturing the specific mechanism through which it matters.",

Wind direction is encoded as orthogonal U and V vector components, as developed in the feature engineering chapter, to preserve the circular geometry of directional data.\nAIC falls to 403,141 (\\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 601\\) versus Model 4). The improvement is the smallest in the sequence, but given the large sample size and the physical plausibility of the effects, the additional wind information is retained.\nThe most informative coefficients are those for the 9:00 AM wind vectors. wind9am_V_NS (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.094\\)) is negative, indicating that southerly airflow increases rainfall intensity. This is consistent with the “Southerly Buster” phenomenon, in which cool moisture-laden air from the Southern Ocean penetrates northward along the eastern seaboard. wind9am_U_EW (\\(\\hat{\\beta} = -0.073\\)) similarly indicates that westerly airflow increases intensity, consistent with the “Roaring Forties” the band of persistent westerly winds at southern latitudes that deliver moisture from the Indian Ocean.\nThe morning wind vectors have coefficients approximately three to four times larger than their peak gust counterparts. This confirms that the prevailing direction of the air mass at the start of the day reflecting the broader synoptic circulation pattern is more informative than turbulent gusts associated with active storm cells. The storm’s provenance matters more than its local expression.\nCoefficients for previously established predictors remain stable across this extension, confirming that the wind vectors explain variance genuinely unaccounted for by earlier components rather than displacing existing effects through collinearity.",

This homogeneity assumption is implausible for a continent as climatologically diverse as Australia.\nModel 6 relaxes it through a mixed-effects structure. Location-specific random effects allow the intercept and three scientifically motivated slopes; humidity, persistence, and dewpoint change to vary across weather stations. Uncorrelated random slopes (diag()) are used rather than a full unstructured covariance matrix, avoiding the overparameterisation that would accompany a freely estimated \\(4 \\times 4\\) random covariance structure across the number of locations in this dataset.\nTwo further additions accompany the move to mixed effects. The zero-inflation submodel is expanded with sunshine, evaporation, and the day-of-year cyclical components, reflecting the hypothesis that occurrence probability is also subject to the full range of atmospheric drivers. And days_since_rain in the zero-inflation submodel is replaced with a four-degree-of-freedom natural spline ns(days_since_rain, df = 4) directly implementing the “rapid-then-gradual” decay identified in the EDA (Chapter 3). The spline allows the probability of a dry spell ending to drop steeply in the first ten days and stabilise thereafter, rather than assuming a constant log-odds decrement per day.\nAIC falls to 396,638, an improvement of \\(\\Delta\\text{AIC} \\approx 6,503\\) relative to Model 5. This is the second-largest single gain after the initial moisture predictors, establishing that spatial heterogeneity is a dominant source of unexplained variance in all the fixed-effects models. The random effects estimates confirm meaningful variability: the random intercept variance (\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 0.12\\)) captures substantial baseline differences in rainfall between locations; the humidity random slope variance (\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 0.023\\)) shows that humidity’s effect on intensity differs across the country; and the persistence random slope variance (\\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 0.013\\)) indicates that the stickiness of wet weather is more pronounced in some climatic zones than others as one would expect contrasting the monsoonal north, where wet seasons persist for months, with the more variable climate of the southeast.\nThe fixed effects for global meteorological drivers; wind vectors, the instability index, and the sunshine-humidity interaction remain significant and directionally consistent with the preceding models. These are robust, continent-wide physical mechanisms whose effects persist even after allowing each location’s parameters to deviate from the global mean.",

Evaluating this component as a classifier allows us to assess how well the model separates the two fundamentally different weather states identified in the Chapter 3.\nDiscriminative ability. The area under the ROC curve is 0.827, meaning that in 82.7% of randomly drawn pairs consisting of one genuinely dry day and one genuinely wet day, the model correctly assigns the higher dryness probability to the dry day. This is a threshold-free measure of separation that does not depend on any particular operating point, and it indicates strong discriminative performance for a meteorological classification problem of this complexity.\nThreshold selection. The raw zero-inflation probability must be converted to a binary prediction through a threshold. Youden’s J statistic which maximises the sum of sensitivity and specificity simultaneously selects an optimal threshold of 0.6314. This is notably higher than the naive 0.5 default, and the reason is structural: because dry days constitute 64% of the sample, the model’s calibrated prior assigns moderate dryness probability to many observations by default. A higher threshold requires more decisive evidence of a dry signal before predicting “No Rain,” which appropriately reflects the prior imbalance in class frequencies.\nConfusion matrix. At this threshold, overall accuracy is 75.28%, decomposing into 69,365 correct dry-day predictions (true negatives), 37,422 correct rain predictions (true positives), 21,473 false alarms (predicted dry, actually wet), and 13,596 missed rain events (predicted wet, actually dry). The model generates false alarms at roughly twice the rate at which it misses rain events. In a meteorological context this asymmetry is operationally desirable: the consequence of carrying an umbrella on a dry day is trivial compared to the consequence of being unprepared for a significant rainfall event. A model biased toward caution is appropriate for this domain.",

Cities to the right of the dashed line produce systematically more rainfall than the national average when all dynamic weather variables are held constant; cities to the left produce systematically less.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random intercepts from the mixed-effects model represent the location-specific baseline deviations in rainfall intensity after removing the contribution of all dynamic weather variables, humidity, pressure, wind, seasonality, and persistence. What remains is the component of rainfall that is attributable to geographic and climatic factors that do not vary day-to-day: proximity to moisture sources, orographic effects, predominant circulation patterns, and regional climate regime.\nThe wetter locations. Katherine (\\(\\hat{b} = 0.54\\)) and Tuggeranong (\\(\\hat{b} = 0.57\\)) sit at the high end of the distribution. Exponentiating these values: \\(e^{0.54} \\approx 1.72\\) and \\(e^{0.57} \\approx 1.77\\), meaning that these stations produce roughly 72% and 77% more rainfall respectively than a hypothetical average Australian location experiencing identical instantaneous weather conditions. This is geographically coherent: both stations sit in the tropical Top End of the Northern Territory, where monsoonal systems deliver sustained and intense rainfall that has no structural analogue in the temperate south, and which the fixed-effects predictors measured on individual days cannot fully capture.\nThe drier locations. Nhil (\\(\\hat{b} = -0.66\\)) and Norfolk Island (\\(\\hat{b} = -0.72\\)) show the strongest negative adjustments. \\(e^{-0.66} \\approx 0.52\\), indicating that Nhil produces roughly half the rainfall of an average location given identical weather conditions. This reflects its position in the semi-arid Wimmera region of inland Victoria, where even moisture-laden air masses tend to deliver less precipitation than they would on the coast.\nJustification for the mixed-effects structure. The magnitude and geographic coherence of these deviations confirm the necessity of the random effects component. A pooled fixed-effects model would have suppressed this spatial variation by averaging across all locations, producing a single set of coefficients that systematically over-predicts rainfall in arid interior stations and under-predicts it in tropical ones. The mixed-effects structure allows the global physical relationships humidity drives intensity, southerly winds bring moisture, to remain stable as fixed effects while accommodating the fact that those relationships operate against a geographically variable baseline.",

DHARMa addresses this by generating a large number of simulated datasets from the fitted model and computing, for each observation, where the actual value falls in the empirical distribution of simulated values. Under a correctly specified model, these scaled residuals follow a uniform distribution on \\([0, 1]\\) regardless of the model family. Deviations from uniformity indicate misspecification.\nQ-Q plot. The empirical quantiles of the scaled residuals align closely with the theoretical diagonal across the full range of the distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test registers \\(p &lt; 0.05\\), but this outcome is expected and should not be interpreted as evidence of meaningful misfit: with \\(N &gt; 140,000\\) observations, the test has sufficient power to detect deviations of negligible practical magnitude. The visual alignment of the Q-Q plot the appropriate diagnostic at this sample size shows no systematic departure from the uniform reference.\nResiduals versus predicted. The three quantile lines (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the scaled residuals at each fitted value) are horizontal and evenly spaced across the range of predictions. This indicates the absence of systematic non-linearity (which would manifest as curvature in the 50th percentile line) and the absence of heteroscedasticity (which would manifest as convergence or divergence of the outer quantile lines). The model performs with equivalent fidelity across the full range of rainfall intensities, from light drizzle to extreme events.\nFormal test results. The dispersion test yields \\(p = 0.36\\), giving no evidence that the variance of the residuals deviates from what the fitted ZIG family implies. The zero-inflation test produces a ratio of observed to simulated zero counts of exactly 1.00 (\\(p = 0.976\\)), confirming that the model’s hurdle component is correctly calibrated and is neither over nor under-predicting the number of dry days in the sample. This last result is particularly notable: it means the 64% zero-inflation rate is not merely matched at the intercept level (as confirmed in the null model calibration check) but is correctly reproduced across the full conditional distribution of covariates.",

If the model has failed to capture all temporal structure in the data, residuals from consecutive days will be correlated, violating the assumption of independent errors and producing standard errors that are too small, confidence intervals that are too narrow, and significance tests that are anti-conservative.\nThis risk is particularly salient here. The raw data exhibits strong temporal autocorrelation: yesterday’s rain state, the weekly wetness trend, and the dry spell dynamics all create day-to-day dependencies that, if unmodelled, would produce heavily autocorrelated residuals. The model addresses this through multiple temporal mechanisms: the Markov persistence feature rain_yesterday, the 7-day moving average features, the natural spline of days_since_rain, and the cyclical seasonal encoding. The question is whether these collectively absorb the temporal signal or whether residual autocorrelation persists.\nThe Durbin-Watson test statistic is 2.0533. The theoretical value under perfect independence is exactly 2.0; values below 2 indicate positive autocorrelation and values above 2 indicate negative autocorrelation. A value of 2.04 is essentially indistinguishable from the ideal, and the associated p-value of 0.1197 gives no grounds to reject the null hypothesis of independence.\nThe ACF plot corroborates this: autocorrelation coefficients at all examined lags fall within the 95% confidence bounds, confirming the absence of any systematic periodic or decay structure in the residuals.\nThe interpretation is that the temporal engineering performed in the feature construction chapter was effective. By explicitly representing the day-to-day Markov structure, the medium-horizon wetness regime, and the non-linear dry spell decay, the model has absorbed the temporal dependence in the data and reduced its residuals to exchangeable noise. What remains unexplained is genuinely unpredictable from the available predictors, not the signature of an omitted temporal component.",

The random effects structure captures geographically coherent spatial heterogeneity that a pooled model would suppress, with the tropical north and arid interior deviating from the national average by factors of approximately 1.8 and 0.5 respectively. The DHARMa diagnostics find no evidence of distributional misspecification, heteroscedasticity, over-dispersion, or miscalibrated zero-inflation. And the temporal autocorrelation test confirms that the model’s persistence and dry spell features have successfully eliminated serial dependence from the residuals.\nTaken together, these results support the conclusion that the final ZIG mixed-effects model is both statistically valid and physically well-grounded, a model whose structure reflects the actual mechanisms generating Australian rainfall rather than artefacts of the fitting procedure.",

The mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.736 mm indicates that the model’s point prediction is within 2.7 mm of the actual recorded value on an average day. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of 7.539 mm is substantially larger, reflecting the asymmetric influence of extreme events in this metric: a small number of days on which a major storm was under-predicted by 50 mm or more exerts a disproportionate upward pull on the squared error average. The gap between MAE and RMSE is therefore informative in itself, confirming that prediction errors are not symmetrically distributed but are concentrated in the tail of the distribution.\nPoint error metrics measure accuracy at the mean but cannot assess whether the model is correctly reproducing the entire shape of the rainfall distribution. A posterior predictive check (PPC) addresses this more demanding criterion. We simulate 50 complete datasets from the fitted model and overlay their empirical densities against the observed distribution. If the model is well-specified, the observed density should be indistinguishable from the simulated envelope.\nThe result (Figure 7.1) shows close agreement across the full range of the distribution. The peak at 0 mm is reproduced accurately, confirming that the zero-inflation component is generating the correct proportion of dry-day predictions conditional on all covariates. The decay rate of the right tail follows the observed data closely, a property that a Gaussian model structurally cannot achieve given its symmetric support. The model is not merely fitting conditional means: it is correctly representing the probabilistic structure of the underlying climate system.",

The Gaussian model predicts negative rainfall, a physical impossibility. Both the Tweedie and ZI-Gamma families respect the zero lower bound and approximate the right tail of the observed distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a distributional family is not a cosmetic decision: it determines the support of the predictions, the variance function, and the structure of the likelihood being optimised. Three families were evaluated against the full predictor set to isolate the contribution of the distributional choice from the contribution of the predictors themselves.\nThe Gaussian model. A standard linear mixed model with Gaussian errors generates predictions that extend into negative values. Because the Gaussian distribution has support over the entire real line, the model has no mechanism to prevent this, and negative rainfall is a physical impossibility. Beyond this qualitative failure, the Gaussian assumption also implies a symmetric and constant variance structure, which is incompatible with the heavy right skew and variance-mean dependence that the EDA (Chapter 3) documented extensively. Fitting a Gaussian model to this data is not merely suboptimal; it produces predictions that are fundamentally inconsistent with the properties of the system being modelled.\nThe Tweedie model. The Tweedie distribution with power parameter \\(p \\in (1, 2)\\) is a compound Poisson-Gamma distribution that naturally accommodates zero values alongside a continuous positive component. It respects the zero lower bound and can represent right-skewed positive data. However, it models zeros and positive values through a single unified process governed by a single mean parameter and the power index. This is a structural constraint: the probability of a zero and the expected positive value are both driven by the same linear predictor, and they cannot be allowed to respond to different sets of covariates.\nThe Zero-Inflated Gamma model. The ZIG framework relaxes this constraint explicitly. The zero-inflation and conditional intensity components have separate linear predictors, which means predictors of occurrence and predictors of intensity are estimated independently. The EDA provides direct empirical motivation for this separation: the Markov analysis showed that rain_yesterday operates primarily through the hurdle, determining whether rain occurs at all, while the pressure change analysis showed that the diurnal pressure signal is more relevant to intensity. These two physical processes do not share the same covariates, and a model that constrains them to do so sacrifices interpretability and predictive accuracy. The ZIG framework gives each process its own parameter vector, making it both more flexible and more physically coherent than the Tweedie alternative.",

Each extension reduces AIC monotonically, confirming that no step introduced net redundancy. The two largest gains correspond to the initial moisture predictors and the final mixed-effects structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nAIC quantifies the information lost when a given model is used to approximate the true data-generating process, penalising complexity to discourage over-fitting. A monotonically decreasing AIC sequence across progressively more complex models is not guaranteed: it is possible to add predictors that improve the likelihood by less than the penalty incurred for the additional parameters, which would cause the AIC to rise. That every extension in this sequence produced a net AIC reduction confirms that each added component captures genuine signal rather than noise.\nThe likelihood ratio test provides the corresponding inferential framework. For two nested models, the test statistic \\(-2 \\ln(\\mathcal{L}_\\text{reduced} / \\mathcal{L}_\\text{full})\\) follows a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters. The null hypothesis is that the additional parameters are jointly zero, meaning the reduced model is adequate. All six comparisons reject this null at \\(p &lt; 0.001\\) after Holm correction for multiple testing. Even the smallest gain in the sequence (wind vectors, M5, \\(\\chi^2 = 608.53\\), \\(df = 4\\)) represents an improvement that is overwhelmingly unlikely under the null, and not merely a consequence of the large sample size: the chi-squared statistic scales with the improvement in log-likelihood, not with \\(N\\) directly.\nThe Akaike weights in the selection table provide a further calibration. With a \\(\\Delta\\text{AIC}\\) of 65,031.5 separating the best and worst models, the weight on M6 rounds to 1.0 to any reasonable decimal precision. There is no realistic information-theoretic case for preferring any earlier model in the sequence.",

Nakagawa’s method provides a principled extension by partitioning the total variance in the model into components attributable to fixed effects, random effects, and residual noise, expressed on the latent (link) scale.\nThe marginal \\(R^2\\) of 0.3498 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by the fixed effects alone: humidity, pressure, wind vectors, seasonality, persistence, and all derived features. The fixed-effects predictors collectively account for 34.9% of the variance in daily rainfall intensity. This is a realistic figure for a system as inherently stochastic as precipitation: the chaotic dynamics of mesoscale atmospheric processes set a fundamental upper bound on predictability from station-level daily observations, and a third of the total variance is a meaningful share of what is structurally predictable.\nThe conditional \\(R^2\\) of 0.4464 incorporates the additional variance explained by the location-specific random effects. The difference between the two values, 0.0966, represents the share of variance attributable purely to geography: the persistent differences between locations that remain after all dynamic weather variables have been controlled for. Approximately 10% of the total variance in Australian daily rainfall is explained not by what the atmosphere is doing today but by where the measurement station sits on the continent. This quantifies, in a single number, the geographic heterogeneity that the random effects structure was designed to capture and that a fixed-effects-only model would leave in the residuals.",

    "text": "7.6 Conclusion\nThe evidence assembled across this chapter supports the following conclusions. The ZIG distributional family is the appropriate choice for this data: the Gaussian model produces physically impossible predictions and the Tweedie model, while valid, constrains occurrence and intensity to share the same linear predictor in a way that is empirically unjustified. Every step in the progressive model sequence represents a statistically significant improvement, confirmed by likelihood ratio tests at \\(p &lt; 0.001\\) after multiple comparison correction, and the Akaike weight of the final model is effectively 1. The posterior predictive check confirms that the model replicates the distributional shape of Australian rainfall, not only its conditional mean. And the variance decomposition establishes that the final model explains 44.6% of total variance, of which approximately a tenth is attributable to the geographic heterogeneity captured by the random effects.",

    "text": "8.1 Summary of Principal Findings\nThis analysis demonstrates that Australian daily rainfall is not a statistical nuisance to be approximated but a structured physical phenomenon generated by distinct, identifiable processes operating at different scales. The final Mixed-Effects Zero-Inflated Gamma model succeeds because it was built to reflect this structure rather than to ignore it.\nThe core argument, supported across six analytical chapters, is that rainfall requires two qualitatively separate sub-models. The occurrence of rain and its intensity are governed by different atmospheric mechanisms, respond to different covariates, and exhibit different temporal and spatial patterns. Conflating them, as a standard linear or Tweedie model does, produces predictions that are physically incoherent, statistically misspecified, and practically inferior.\nThe “Rain Corner” threshold. Rainfall occurrence is not a simple linear function of humidity or sunshine individually. It concentrates in a specific region of the bivariate feature space where afternoon humidity exceeds approximately 60% and daily sunshine falls below approximately five hours simultaneously. This interaction is highly significant (\\(p &lt; 0.001\\)), stable across all model specifications, and physically interpretable: the conjunction of a saturated atmosphere and suppressed solar radiation creates the thermodynamic conditions necessary for precipitation. Neither condition alone is sufficient.\nMarkovian persistence. Daily weather observations are not exchangeable. Having rained the previous day increases the probability of rain today by 76% relative to a dry antecedent, making rain_yesterday the single strongest predictor in the zero-inflation component across the entire model sequence. The Markov Chain analysis established that dry states are highly sticky (85% probability of remaining dry), while wet states are transient (47% probability of continued rain). A model that treats each day as conditionally independent given covariates is misspecified in a way that materially degrades occurrence prediction.\nWind vector dynamics. Wind direction is a circular variable whose information is destroyed by naive numeric encoding. Decomposing compass bearings into orthogonal north-south and east-west components revealed that southerly and westerly airflows are the dominant directional drivers of rainfall intensity, consistent with the known influence of Southern Ocean frontal systems and the mid-latitude westerlies. Morning wind direction, reflecting the prevailing synoptic circulation, was approximately three to four times more informative than peak gust direction, reflecting local turbulence.\nSpatial heterogeneity. The random effects analysis established that approximately 10% of total variance in Australian rainfall is attributable to location-specific baseline differences that persist after all dynamic weather variables are controlled. The tropical Top End stations produce roughly 1.7 to 1.8 times more rainfall than the national average at identical atmospheric conditions, while arid interior stations produce approximately half as much. A fixed-effects model would average these extremes, systematically under-predicting flood risk in Darwin and over-predicting rainfall in Nhil.",

    "text": "8.3 Limitations\nTail underestimation. The Gamma distribution accommodates right skew but has exponentially declining tails rather than power-law tails. Rare, catastrophic events exceeding approximately 50 mm per day, the 1-in-100-year flood category are systematically under-predicted. The model correctly identifies when conditions are conducive to extreme rainfall but underestimates how extreme the event will be. This is an inherent property of the Gamma family, not a failure of model specification within that family.\nStationarity assumption. All parameters are estimated from a fixed historical record and are assumed to be stable over time. The model does not encode long-term non-stationarity arising from shifts in the Southern Oscillation Index, the Indian Ocean Dipole, or anthropogenic forcing. Predictions made under climate trajectories that lie outside the historical parameter space are extrapolations.\nObservational confounding. Coefficient estimates represent conditional associations, not causal effects. Unobserved variables including soil moisture feedback, aerosol loading, and land surface characteristics may confound the estimated meteorological relationships. The model is appropriate for prediction under conditions similar to the training data; causal attribution of rainfall to specific drivers requires experimental or quasi-experimental designs.",

    "text": "8.5 Recommended Extensions\nExtreme value tail augmentation. A natural extension is a composite model that applies the ZIG framework to the body of the distribution and grafts a Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) to exceedances above the 95th percentile. This preserves the 44% conditional \\(R^2\\) on typical days while correcting the systematic underestimation that limits the model’s utility for flood risk applications.\nLarge-scale climate indices. The Southern Oscillation Index and the Indian Ocean Dipole modulate Australian rainfall at interannual timescales and are not currently in the feature set. Including them as slowly-varying covariates in the conditional intensity or zero-inflation component would allow the model to shift its baseline predictions between El Nino and La Nina years, addressing a known gap in predictive accuracy for anomalous climate regimes.\nDynamic updating. The current model is static: it is estimated once from the full historical record. A natural operational extension would implement sequential updating, re-estimating or fine-tuning the random effects as new observations accumulate, allowing location-specific baselines to track gradual shifts in local climate.",

Australian rainfall is zero-inflated, spatially heterogeneous, temporally autocorrelated, and driven by non-linear thermodynamic interactions. The Zero-Inflated Gamma mixed-effects model is not a complex model. It is the appropriately simple model for a complex phenomenon. Its performance advantage over a linear baseline is not a consequence of added parameters but of a better alignment between model structure and physical reality.",
