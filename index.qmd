# Predicting the Unpredictable {.unnumbered}

## Executive Summary

Australian rainfall dynamics represent a significant challenge for classical frequentist methods. The data violates every core assumption of OLS: **64% zero-inflation**, a distribution **kurtosis of 181.15**, and strong **Markovian persistence**. 

This project rejects the "one-size-fits-all" Gaussian approach, implementing a **Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG) Mixed Model**. By treating rainfall as two distinct physical processes: **occurrence** (hurdle) and **intensity** (volume); and accounting for spatial heterogeneity through random slopes, this framework provides a robust solution for spatiotemporal weather forecasting.

## Technical Highlights

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Data Engineering

* **Hybrid Imputation:** A multi-stage pipeline combining temporal interpolation with Random Forest PMM via `missRanger` to resolve 47% missingness in sunshine data without shrinking variance.
* **Wind Vectorization:** Resolved the $0^\circ/360^\circ$ boundary discontinuity by decomposing compass bearings into continuous North-South ($V$) and East-West ($U$) components.
* **Signal Extraction:** Utilized 7-day moving averages as low-pass filters to suppress daily stochastic noise and reveal latent wet-weather regimes.
* **Feature Interaction:** Engineered a centered `sunshine × humidity3pm` interaction term to capture the non-linear "Rain Corner" threshold while maintaining a VIF of 1.25.

### Statistical Framework

* **Mixed-Effects Architecture:** Implemented uncorrelated random intercepts and slopes: $\text{diag}(1 + \text{humidity} + \text{persistence} \mid \text{location})$; allowing the physics of rainfall to vary across the continent.
* **Non-Linear Persistence:** Utilized natural splines: $ns(\text{days\_since\_rain}, df = 4)$; within the zero-inflation component to model the non-linear "drying effect" of ongoing droughts.
* **Parameter Estimation:** Fitted via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) using the Template Model Builder (`glmmTMB`) for computational efficiency in high-dimensional mixed models.
* **Diagnostic Rigor:** Verified via **DHARMa** simulation-based residuals, confirming ideal dispersion ($p = 0.19$) and perfect zero-calibration (ratio = 1.00).

### Key Findings

* **The Rain Corner:** Rainfall is gated by a thermodynamic threshold: precipitation is negligible unless afternoon humidity exceeds ~50% and sunshine duration falls below 5 hours.
* **Spatial Variance:** After controlling for all meteorological covariates, **10% of total variance** is explained by geography alone, highlighting the dominance of local micro-climates.
* **Intensity Drivers:** Southerly and Westerly wind vectors were identified as the primary drivers of intensity, reflecting the influence of Southern Ocean frontal systems.
* **Classification Power:** The model achieved an **AUC of 0.83**, demonstrating high discriminative capacity between dry and rainy states.

## The Mathematical Framework

The model assumes that rainfall $y_i$ is a realization of a mixture of a point mass at zero and a Gamma-distributed continuous variable.

**The Conditional Probability:**
$$y_i \mid y_i > 0 \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu_i, \phi)$$
$$\log(\mu_i) = \mathbf{X}_i\beta + \mathbf{Z}_i\mathbf{b}$$

**The Zero-Inflation (Logistic) Hurdle:**
$$\text{logit}(\pi_i) = \mathbf{W}_i\gamma + \nu_{location}$$

Where $\pi_i$ is the probability of a structural dry day, $\mathbf{X}_i$ and $\mathbf{W}_i$ are predictor matrices, and $\mathbf{Z}_i\mathbf{b}$ represents the random slope components.
