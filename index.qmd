# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Rainfall in Australia is a story of extremes. Driven by the complex interplay of the Southern Ocean’s Westerlies and the tropical monsoon, Australian weather patterns oscillate violently between prolonged droughts and torrential flood events. For meteorologists and data scientists, modeling this phenomenon presents a dual challenge: predicting **if** it will rain (occurrence) and **how much** will fall (intensity).

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of daily observations from diverse locations across Australia, aiming to accurately model these dynamics using advanced statistical frameworks in **R**.

### The Statistical Challenge

Standard statistical approaches often assume data follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. However, daily rainfall data violates every assumption of linear regression:

1.  **Zero-Inflation:** Approximately **64%** of observations are dry days (0mm). A standard model struggles to predict exact zeros, often outputting physically impossible negative values.
2.  **Extreme Skewness:** When it does rain, the distribution is highly right-skewed. The "long tail" of storm events drives the bulk of the variance.
3.  **Spatiotemporal Dependence:** Rain is not independent. A wet day in Darwin does not behave like a wet day in Melbourne, and a wet yesterday strongly predicts a wet today.

To address these challenges, we utilize a **Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG) Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM)** framework. This allows us to model the *probability of rain* (Logistic component) and the *intensity of rain* (Gamma component) as distinct but related physical processes.

### Objectives

To achieve a robust analysis, this report addresses the following key objectives:

-   **Data Integrity:** Implement a Random Forest imputation strategy to handle missing values without discarding critical information.

-   **Temporal Dynamics:** Investigate the "persistence" effect using Markov Chain analysis to determine how prior weather states influence current rainfall probabilities.

-   **Physical Modeling:** Reconstruct the drivers of rainfall by layering **Moisture**, **Energy**, **Wind Vectors**, and **Spatial Heterogeneity** into the model.

-   **Model Selection:** Rigorously compare standard linear models against the Zero-Inflated Gamma framework using AIC, BIC, and DHARMa residual diagnostics.
